<p>Until this point in our discussions of probability we have relied upon characterizing the behaviour of a random variable via the use of probability mass functions. In some sense, a probability mass function captures all of the probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random variable. Using the mass function you are able to characterize how often, in the long run, any particular value will be observed, and answer any questions associated with this. As a result, the mass function remains a critical area of focus for understanding how random quantities behave.</p>
<p>However, these functions need to be explored and manipulated in order for useful information to be extracted from them. They do not summarize this behaviour effectively, as they are not intended to be a summary tool. We may wish to have numeric quantities which are able to <em>concisely</em> express the behaviour of a distribution. Put differently, provided with a probability mass function it is hard to immediately answer “what do we expect to happen with this random variable?” despite the fact that this is a very obvious first question.</p>
<p>To address questions related to our expectations, we turn towards the statistical concept of central tendency or location.</p>
<div id="def-location" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.1 (Location (Central Tendency))</strong></span> The location of a distribution is a measure of a typical value, or a central value, for that distribution. A measure of location may also be referred to as a measure of central tendency.</p>
</div>
<p>With measures of location we are trying to capture, with one single number, what value is expected when we make observations from the random quantity. There are many ways one might think to describe our expectations, and it is worth exploring these concepts in some detail. In particular, we want to explore how we might think to define the <strong>expected value</strong> of a distribution.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3 data-number="6.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mode"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> The Mode</h3>
<p>One way that we may think to define our expected value is by asking what value is the most probable. This is a question which can be directly answered using the probability mass function. The process for this requires looking at the function and determining which value for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> corresponds to the highest probability. This is the value that we are most likely to see. Sometimes this procedure is fairly straightforward, sometimes it is quite complicated. Regardless of the complexity of the specific scenario, the most probable value has a straightforward interpretation. As intuitive as this may seem, this is not the value that will be used as <em>the</em> expected value generally. Instead, this quantity is referred to as the mode.</p>
<div id="def-mode" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.2 (Mode)</strong></span> The mode of a distribution is the most probable value of that distribution. Specifically, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a discrete random variable with mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>, then the mode is the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span> is maximized.</p>
</div>
<div id="exm-mode" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 6.1 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles)</strong></span> Charles and Sadie have noticed that their favourite coffee shop has been experiencing less foot traffic ever since <em>Probability Patisserie: Cupcake Conundrums</em> has opened up next door.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This cupcake shop has been attracting many of the regular customers, though, Charles and Sadie think that it has more to do with fancy marketing than with a better product. To this end, they go into the store and workout the probability mass function for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the number of sprinkles on top of the cupcakes. They find the following <span class="math display">\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0.25 &amp; x = 0 \\ 0.3 &amp; x = 1 \\ 0.1 &amp; x = 2 \\ 0.05 &amp; x \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]</span></p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The mode is the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span> is a maximum. In this case the maximum occurs when <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(p_X(1) = 0.3\)</span>, and so the mode of the number of sprinkles is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the mode is a useful quantity, and for some decisions will be the most relevant summary value, there are some major issues with it as a general measure of location. For starters, consider that our most common probability model considered until this point has been that of equally likely outcomes. Here, there is no well-defined mode.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> While the case of equally likely outcomes is a fairly strong example highlighting the issues with the mode, it need not be so dramatic to undermine its utility. It is possible for a distribution to have several modes which are quite distinct from one another, even if it’s not all values in the support.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite common for the modal value to be not particularly likely itself. Consider a random variable that can take on a million different values. If all of the probabilities are approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.000001\)</span> then presenting the mode as the most probable value does not translate to saying that the mode is particularly probable.</p>
<div id="exm-triangular-distributions" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 6.2 (Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Happiness)</strong></span> After realizing that the cupcake shop did not provide very many sprinkles, Charles and Sadie decided to turn to the marketing material. In it, <em>Cupcake Conundrums</em> claims that, on a scale from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(100,000\)</span> happiness points, most of their customers experience the maximum happiness after eating their cupcakes. Charles and Sadie are well aware of the ways in which these types of reports can be misleading, and so they investigate, finding the following probability mass function for the number of happiness points. <span class="math display">\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{x}{5,000,050,000} &amp; x \in \{1,\dots,100 000\} \\

<li><p>Yes. Note that <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span> is increasing in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.

<li><p>The mode is likely not a good indication of the distribution. Note that the maximal value happens only <span class="math inline">\(100000/5000050000\)</span> of the time, which is a very very small value. If you look at the probability that a customer is only halfway happy, this is <span class="math inline">\(50000/5000050000\)</span>. This value is half the likelihood of the modal value, but the difference between these two probabilities is also only <span class="math inline">\(50000/5000050000 \approx 0.000001\)</span>. That is, it is only <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(100,000\)</span> more likely to observe perfect happiness compared with half happiness.

<p>If the mode has these shortcomings, what else might work? Another intuitive concept is to try to select the “middle” of the distribution. One way to define the middle would be to select the value such that, in the long run, half of observations from the distribution are beneath it and half are above it. That way, when you are told this value, you immediately know that it is equally likely to observe values on either side of this mark. This is also a particularly intuitive definition for expected value, and is important enough to be named, the median.</p>
<div id="def-median" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.3 (Median)</strong></span> The median of a distribution is the value <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> which attempts to have <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq m) = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq m) = 0.5\)</span>. This value may not always exist, and so formally for discrete random variables, the median <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is any value such that <span class="math inline">\(P(X \leq m) \geq 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq m) \geq 0.5\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The median is the midpoint of a distribution and is very important for describing the behaviour of random variables. Medians are often the most helpful single value to report to indicate the typical behaviour of a distribution, and they are frequently used. When people interpret averages it is often the median that they are actually interpreting. It is very intuitive to be given a value and know that half of all realizations are above that point, and half of all realizations are below that point.</p>
<div id="exm-median" class="theorem example">

<p>Despite the advantages of medians, they have their own drawbacks. For starters, the median can be exceptionally challenging to compute in certain settings. As a result, even when a median is appropriate, it may not be desirable if it is too challenging to determine.</p>
<p>Beyond the difficulties in computation, medians have a feature which is simultaneously a major benefit and a major drawback. Specifically, medians are less influenced by extreme values in the probability distribution. Consider two different distributions. The first is equally likely to take any value between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. The second is equally likely to take any value between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span>. In both of these settings, the median is <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(P(X\leq 5) = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X \geq 5) = 0.5\)</span>. However, in the second setting we may observe a value as high as <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span>. Moreover, this value will be observed as often as the median will be.</p>
<p>The median, in some sense, ignores the extreme value in the probability distribution. In certain settings, this can be very desirable.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Consider the distribution of household incomes. There are a few households that earn an incredibly large amount, compared to the remaining households. If you are interested in understanding the “average household”, the median may be a more appropriate measure, as those households with extreme incomes would otherwise distort the picture provided by most families. In this sense, the median’s robustness to extreme values is a positive feature of it in terms of a summary measure for distributional behaviour.</p>
<p>Suppose instead that you work for an insurance company and are concerned with understanding the value of insurance claims that your company will need to pay out. The distribution will look quite similar to the income distribution. Most of the probability will be assigned to fairly small claims, with a small chance of a very large one. As an insurance company, if you use the median this large claim behaviour will be smoothed over, perhaps leaving you unprepared for the possibility of extremely large payouts. In this setting, the extreme values are informative and important, and as a result the median’s robustness becomes a hindrance to correctly describing the important behaviour.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Between the median and the mode we have two measures which capture some sense of expected value, each with their own set of strengths and drawbacks. Neither capture what it is that is referred to as <em>the</em> expected value. For this, we need to take inspiration from the median, and consider another way that we may think to find the center of the distribution.</p>

<p>If the median gives the middle reading along the values sequentially, we may also wish to think about trying to find the <em>center of gravity</em> of the numbers. Suppose you take a pen, or marker, or small box of chocolates, and you wish to balance this object on a finger or an arm. To do so, you do not place the item so that half of its length sits on one side of the appendage and half on the other. You adjust the location so that half of the <em>mass</em> sits on either side of the appendage.</p>
<p>Throughout our discussion of discrete random variables we have referred to probability as <em>mass</em>. We use the <em>probability mass function</em> to generate our probability values. This metaphor can be extended when we try to find the center of the distribution. If we imagine placing a mass with weight equal to the probability mass at each value that a random variable can take on, we may ask, “where would we have to place a fulcrum to have this number line be balanced?” The answer to this question serves as another possible measure of center. It turns out that this notion of center is the one that we are all most familiar with, the simple average, or mean.</p>
<div id="def-mean" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 6.4 (Mean)</strong></span> The mean of a distribution is the center of mass of the distribution. For a random variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with support <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span>, and probability mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>, the mean of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} xp_X(x).\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>It is this measure of location which ends up being called the <strong>expected value</strong> in statistics. We will use average, expected value, mean, and expectation interchangeably. In terms of notation, the expected value of a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>. Mathematically, the expected value is desirable for many reasons, some of which we will study in more depth later on. One of these desirable features, which stands in contrast with the median, is the comparative ease with which expected values can be computed. The summation for the expected value is easy to write down, and typically can be solved (either analytically, or readily with a computer).</p>

<p>While the mean provides a useful, intuitive measure of center of the distribution, it is perhaps counterintuitive to name it the “expected value.” To understand the naming convention it is easiest to consider the application which has likely spurred more development of statistics and probability than any other: gambling.</p>
<p>Suppose that there is some game of chance that can pay out different amounts with different probabilities. A critical question for a gambler in deciding whether or not to play such a game is “how much can I expect to earn, if I play?” This is crucial to understanding, for instance, how much you should be willing to pay to participate, or if you are the one running the game, how much you should charge to ensure that you make a profit.</p>
<p>If you want to understand what you expect to earn, the intuitive way of accomplishing this is to weight each possible outcome by how likely it is to occur. This is exactly the expected value formula that has been provided, and so the expected value can be thought of as the expected payout of a game of chance where the outcomes are payouts corresponding to each probability.</p>

Cost for a Game of Chance
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Suppose that a game of chance is being run. It will cost <span class="math inline">\(\$m\)</span> to play, and the game will pay out values from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span>, according to a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with probability mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>. The question that we want to know is what should the value be for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, such that, in the long term, a player playing the game will earn no money?</p>
<p>Note that if <span class="math inline">\(X=x\)</span> then a player playing the game will earn <span class="math inline">\(x - m\)</span> for that play, and this will happen with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span>. Thus, in the long run, in <span class="math inline">\(p_X(x)\)</span> proportion of games the player earns <span class="math inline">\(x-m\)</span>. If the player plays <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> games, then as <span class="math inline">\(N\to\infty\)</span>, the total contribution from these winnings will be <span class="math inline">\((x-m)\cdot N\cdot p_X(x)\)</span>. If we add up this contribution for all possible results, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} N(x-m)p_X(x) &amp;= N\left[\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} mp_X(x)\right] \\
&amp;= N\left[\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - m\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_X(x)\right] \\
&amp;= N\left[E[X] - m\right].
\end{align*}\]</span> Thus, in the long run, the total that the player wins, as <span class="math inline">\(N\to\infty\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(N(E[X] - m)\)</span>. Thus, in order for the long run earnings to be zero, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> should be set to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is set to be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then per game the player <em>expects</em> to earn <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>. This also represents the cost at which a rational actor should be willing to pay to participate. If a game of chance costs more than the expected value to play, in the long run you will lose money. If a game of chance costs less than the expected value, in the long run you will earn money. It is hard to overstate the utility of gambling in developing probability theory, and as such these types of connections are expected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To interpret the expected value of a random variable, one possibility is using the intuition that we used to derive the result. Notably, the expected value is the center of mass of the distribution, where the masses correspond to probabilities. This means that it is not necessarily an actual central number over the range, but rather that it sits in the weighted middle. While this interpretation is useful in many situations, there are times where the point of balance is a less intuitive description. For these, it can sometimes be useful to frame the expected value as the long term simple average from the distribution.</p>
<p>If we imagine observing many independent and identically distributed random variables, then as the number of samples tends to infinity, the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the simple average will begin to coincide with one another. That is the distance between <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\)</span> will shrink to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. As a result, we can view the expected value as the average over repeated experiments. This interpretation coincides nicely with the description based on games of chance. Specifically, if you were to repeatedly play the same game of chance, the average payout per game will be equal to the expected value, if you play for long enough.</p>

<p>Where the median demonstrated robustness against extreme values in the distribution, the mean does not. For instance, if we consider the distribution of incomes across a particular region, the mean will be much higher than the median, since those families with exceptionally high incomes will not be smoothed over as they were with medians. In this case, the lack of robustness for the expected value will render the mean a less representative summary for the true behaviour of the random quantity.</p>
<p>To see this concretely consider a random variable which with equal probability takes a value between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>. This will have <span class="math inline">\(E[X] = 5\)</span>. Now, if the <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> is made to be <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span>, the expected value will now be <span class="math inline">\(E[X] = 111115.\dot1\)</span>. This is a far cry from the median which does not change from <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> in either case. This lack of robustness is desirable in the event of the insurance example from the median discussion, but will be less desirable in other settings.</p>
<p>The mean, median, and mode are the three standard measures of central tendency. They are single values which describe the standard behaviour of a random quantity. Each of the three has merits as a measure, and each has drawbacks for certain settings. The question of which to use and when depends primarily on the question of interest under consideration, rather than on features of the data alone.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Often, presenting more than one measure can give a better sense of the distributional behaviour that any one individual will.</p>

<li><p>There is an argument that any of the measures here could work the best, it would depend on the individual’s preferences. The mode makes a lot of sense as, if you are a regular customer, the mode is what you will experience day-to-day; most days you will have the modal number of sprinkles. The median may make sense as it provides a benchmark for measuring what constitutes a lot of sprinkles and a little. Half of the time you’ll end up with a more sprinkled donut, half the time a less. The mean would be particularly interesting to note for the store owners themselves, since the mean is directly tied to totals: if the store knows that they sell <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> cupcakes per day, most days, then they also can expect to use <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> times the mean number of sprinkles in a day.

<li><p>The median is likely the most useful measure in this setting. The mode could be useful if happiness were not measured on a <span class="math inline">\(100,000\)</span> point scale.

<li><p>In this case either the mode or mean are likely the best gauges. Here we do care about totals, and in particular, we do not want to smooth over outliers.

<p>Despite the utility of all three measures, the expected value holds a place of more central importance in probability and statistics.

<p>Sometimes the value of a random variable needs to be mapped through a function to give the value which is most relevant to us. Consider, for instance, a situation wherein the side lengths of boxes being manufactured by a specific supplier are random, due to incorrectly calibrated tolerances in the machines. The resulting boxes are perfect cubes. Suppose we are interested in the volume of the produced box not the side length. If a box has side length <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then its volume will be <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, and so we may desire some way of computing <span class="math inline">\(E[X^3]\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(E[X]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Generally, for a function <span class="math inline">\(g(X)\)</span>, we may want to compute <span class="math inline">\(E[g(X)]\)</span>. It is important to recognize that <span class="math inline">\(E[g(X)] \neq g(E[X])\)</span>. This is a common mistake.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> If we are unable to apply the function to the expected value, then the question of how to compute the expected value remains. Instead of applying the function to overall expected value, instead, we apply the function to <em>each</em> value in the defining relationship for the expected value. That is, <span class="math display">\[E[g(X)] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x).\]</span> This is sometimes referred to as the “law of the unconscious statistician,” a name which may be aggressive enough to help remember the correct way to compute the expectation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 6.7 (The Happiness Scale Inversion)</strong></span> Charles and Sadie have made really great strides working to protect their favourite coffee shop from the new cupcake store. One day when digging through the material more, they realize that the happiness report produced by the company is even less accurate than they had originally reported! The company reported the following probability mass function for happiness points <span class="math display">\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}

Instead, the number of happiness points is a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, specifically, <span class="math inline">\(Z = 1/X\)</span>.</p>

<p>These functions applied to random variables are often thought of as “transformations” of the random quantities. For instance, we <em>transformed</em> a side length into a volume. While the law of the unconscious statistician will apply to any transformation for a random variable, we can sometimes use shortcuts to circumvent its application. In particular, when <span class="math inline">\(g(X) = aX + b\)</span>, for constant numbers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, we can greatly simplify the expected value of the transformation. To see this note <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E[aX + b] &amp;= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}(ax + b)p_X(x) \\
&amp;= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}axp_X(x) + bp_X(x) \\
&amp;= a\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + b\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_X(X) \\
&amp;= aE[X] + b.
\end{align*}\]</span> That is, in general, we have that <span class="math inline">\(E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful as linear transformations like <span class="math inline">\(aX+b\)</span> arise very commonly. For instance, most unit conversions are simple linear combinations. If a random quantity is measured in one unit then this result can be used to quickly convert expectations to another.</p>

<p>Measures of central tendency are important to summarize the behaviour of a random quantity. Whether using the mean, median, or mode, these measures of location describe, on average, what to expect from observations of the random quantity. However, understanding a distribution requires understanding far more than simply the measures of location. As was discussed previously, the probability mass function captures the complete probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random variable, it is only intuitive that some information would be lost with a single numeric summary.</p>
