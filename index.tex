\section*{What are these notes?}\label{what-are-these-notes}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What are these notes?}

\markright{What are these notes?}

These notes are being written to supplement the Winter 2024 offering of
STAT 1793 at the University of New Brunswick on the Saint John campus.
These are intended to provide the complete set of notes required to be
successful in the course, along with a series of examples. Note that, if
you are a student in the offering of STAT 1793, the specific material
that we cover and focus on may be a subset of these notes: we will be
crafting our path through them together, as a class, and as such, not
all material will be equally relevant. It is important to check the
course website and to listen in lecture to ensure that you are always
aware of what is being emphasized, what will be covered on the
assessments, and so forth.

Moreover, it is important to note that these notes are a
work-in-progress. As of today (January 5, 2024), the material through to
Chapter 5 has been made up-to-date. Further chapters will be added
throughout term. Additionally, some of the completed chapters may be
revised in an attempt to add clarity, fix mistakes or typos, and to
better format or sequence the material. If at any point you have
comments, questions, suggestions, or corrections to these notes, please
do reach out! They are intended to be a helpful resource to ensure your
success in the course, and to help your probability and statistics
skills into the future.

One final note is that our coverage of concepts throughout STAT 1793
reflects my personal biases and proclivities towards what is important
in a first course in probability and statistics. Compared to others I
likely have a larger emphasis on probability, leaving concepts more tied
to statistics to a second course (e.g., STAT 2793). This is reflected
both in the ordering of material (we start at Probability not at
Statistics), and in the weight that each topic will be given. It is my
belief that you need to be able to fluently speak the language of
probability in order to study statistics, and that is where we will put
our focus. However, this does mean that if you have impressions or
content from another offering of the course, they may be less
well-suited to the specific range of topics we will cover. The material
is all the same, and if they help you learn, by all means; it is however
important to emphasize that what is highlighted will likely be
different.

\section*{Using These Notes}\label{using-these-notes}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Using These Notes}

\markright{Using These Notes}

These notes are best viewed online. You can access them from anywhere at
\url{https://dylanspicker.github.io/STAT1793-course-notes/index.html}.
Viewing online will allow you to take advantage of interactivity (such
as through code blocks and solutions hiding), the search feature
(visible in the left hand margin), as well as better overall formatting.
There is a version of these notes in PDF format available. To download
them, press the PDF icon button () next to the note title in the left
hand bar. The PDF notes contain all the same content, and will be
updated alongside the web notes. The formatting of the PDF document may
be less visually appealing compared to the web notes. Though an effort
will be made to ensure that everything remains legible, and
well-formatted, the aesthetics of these notes will be a lower priority
than those available on the web.

To successfully use these notes, I would recommend a several step
procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Prior to the lecture where the material will be covered, read through
  the sections that are to be covered. For examples, do not read the
  solution, and instead try to think of how the example can be solved
  (perhaps trying to solve it yourself).
\item
  Attend lecture and be engaged. Our lectures will follow along with the
  course notes rather closely, including doing as a class many of the
  example problems. As a result, this will reemphasize what you have
  read.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Note, by reading \emph{before} you come to class you will be seeing
    the material for a second time, allowing you to better process it.
  \item
    Additionally, this will allow you to better follow the parts that
    were confusing in the notes, and be more prepared to ask questions
    of me throughout the lecture.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Return to the notes after class to ensure that everything has made
  sense. At this point try solving the example problems directly without
  referencing the solutions at all.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Only once you've gotten a solution to the problem should you check
    if it is correct. When checking, only look as far as any mistakes
    that have been made, and then try the problem again.
  \item
    Note: struggling with problems is a key component of learning in any
    mathematical discipline. It is only by struggling to understand how
    the pieces fit together that you will develop a proper understanding
    for yourself.
  \item
    Looking at solutions will often undermine your own understanding. It
    is a much different process to look at a solution and understand why
    it is correct, than it is to determine a solution for yourself.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ask questions, attend office hours, and send emails as is required to
  ensure you are fully successful in the course!
\end{enumerate}

Throughout the notes there will be references to computer code in a
programming language known as R. R is the most common language used for
statistics by practicing statisticians, and it is a great utility for
many of the types of problems we will be considering in this course. You
are not expected to be able to write R code throughout the course,
however, there is plenty of material throughout the notes to ensure that
you will be able to read and run R code. This will be required for
solving certain problems, and will make the process of statistics far
nicer to engage with. If you are using the web notes this code can all
be run directly in the browser. If you are using the PDF notes, the code
and output is still provided. In either case, I would suggest getting R
running on your own device, if possible. It is free to
\href{https://cran.rstudio.com/}{download and install}. I would also
suggest installing \href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{R
Studio}, which is a program specifically designed for writing and
running R code with a lot of nice features.

\section*{Some Mathematical
Background}\label{some-mathematical-background}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Some Mathematical Background}

\markright{Some Mathematical Background}

These notes (and this course more broadly) require high school
mathematics to complete. There is no calculus specifically required. The
assumption is that you will be comfortable manipulating mathematical
expressions, solving basic equations, using a calculator, and so forth.
The following are a handful of topics which will come up throughout the
course that are assumed to be known, presented here in brief as a quick
reference.

\subsection*{Logarithms and Exponent
Rules}\label{logarithms-and-exponent-rules}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Logarithms and Exponent Rules}

Recall that if \(a^x = b\), then we can solve for \(x\) through the use
of logarithms. Specifically, \(x = \log_a(b)\), where we read this as
``the logarithm with base \(a\) of \(b\).'' The expression means that
``\(x\) is the exponent we put on \(a\) to get \(b\).'' In this
course\footnote{And in most math courses beyond a certain point.} we use
the notation \(\log(x)\) to represent the \textbf{natural logarithm}.
The natural logarithm is \(\log_e(x)\), where \(e \approx  2.71828\) is
Euler's number. The \textbf{exponential function} is given by
\(e^{x} = \exp(x)\). Which notation is used depends on the specific
setting, but both are equivalent.

Recall further the following exponent and log rules:\begin{align*}
a^b\times a^c &= a^{b + c} \\
a^b\times c^b &= (ac)^b \\
a^{-b} &= \frac{1}{a^b} \\
\left(a^{b}\right)^c &= a^{bc} \\
a^0 &= 1 \\
\log(ab) &= \log(a) + \log(b) \\
\log(a^b) &= b\log(a) \\
\log(1) &= 0 \\
\log(e) &= 1.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Summation and Product
Notation}\label{summation-and-product-notation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Summation and Product Notation}

If we wish to add up a series of numbers, \(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\) then we
can use summation notation to record this. Specifically,
\[x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i.\] Here \(i\) is an
indexing variable just used to keep track of which number we are
currently working on. Note that the following quantities will hold
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n cx_i &= c\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.
\end{align*}

We can also use a similar shorthand to discuss repeated products. That
is, if we want to multiply \(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\), then we can write
\[x_1\times x_2\times\cdots\times x_n = \prod_{i=1}^n x_i.\] Again,
\(i\) is used as an indexing variable to keep track of what value is
currently being multiplied. The following results hold \begin{align*}
    \prod_{i=1}^n x &= x^n \\
    \prod_{i=1}^n b^{x_i} &= b^{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} \\
    \prod_{i=1}^n cx_i &= c^n\prod_{i=1}^n x_i.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Other Important Points}\label{other-important-points}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Other Important Points}

The following are some additional points that are useful to know, but
which do not necessarily fit together nicely.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For any two values \(x\) and \(y\), we get
  \((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\).
\item
  The integers are the set of all whole numbers,
  \(\{0, \pm1,\pm2,\dots\}\). We will often denote the set of integers
  using \(\mathbb{Z}\).
\item
  The natural numbers are the set of all counting numbers, either
  \(\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}\) or else \(\{1,2,3,4,\cdots\}\) depending on the
  source. We often denote the set using \(\mathbb{N}\).
\item
  The real numbers are the set of all numbers that you think of when
  thinking of numbers. They include the integers, and any fractions, and
  anything that cannot be written as a fraction (like \(\pi\) and \(e\))
  as well. We denote the real numbers as \(\mathbb{R}\).
\item
  Intervals of real numbers are denoted as \((a,b)\) or \([a,b]\) (or a
  mixture, giving \([a,b)\) or \((a,b]\)). A round bracket means that
  the endpoint is \textbf{not} included in the set, where a square
  bracket means that it is. That is, a value of \(x\) is in \((a,b)\) if
  \(a < x < b\), where it is in \([a,b]\) if \(a \leq x \leq b\).
\item
  We write ``\(x\) is in the interval \((a,b)\)'' mathematically using
  the \(\in\) symbol. Specifically, \(x \in (a,b)\).
\item
  Infinity (\(\infty\)) is not a number. Rather, it is a statement
  regarding the lack of a bound. When we say that something is infinity,
  or infinite, we simply mean that it is larger than any of the natural
  numbers. If you were to be given any number, then infinity will be
  larger than that.
\item
  \textbf{Limits:} note that, while limits are from calculus, they are
  useful for formally understanding a few concepts in class. The limit
  of a function, \(f(x)\), is simply the value that the function
  approaches as \(x\) approaches a specific point. So, for instance,
  \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x)\) is the value that \(f(x)\) approaches as \(x\)
  approaches \(a\). If \(f(a)\) exists then it is simply \(f(a)\).
  However, \(f(a)\) may not exist, at which point, we look at where the
  function is tending to.
\item
  \textbf{Infinite Limits:} Of specific importance to us are infinite
  limits. Specifically, \[\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)\] captures the beahviour
  of the function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) gets larger and larger. In many
  cases, \(f(x)\) will approach some specific value, which we assign to
  be the limiting value of the function.
\end{itemize}

\section{What is Probability?}\label{what-is-probability}

At its core, statistics is the study of uncertainty. Uncertainty
permeates the world around us, and in order to make sense of the world,
we need to make sense of uncertainty. The language of uncertainty is
\textbf{probability}. Probability is a concept which we all likely have
some intuitive sense of. If there was a 90\% probability of rain today,
you likely considered grabbing an umbrella. You are not likely to wager
your life savings on a game that has only a 1\% probability of paying
out. We have a sense that probability provides a measure of
\emph{likelihood}. Defining probability mathematically is a non-trivial
task, and there have been many attempts to formalize it throughout
history. While we will spend a good deal of time formalizing notions of
probability in this course, we first pause to emphasize the familiarity
with probability that you are likely starting with.

Suppose that two friends, Charles and Sadie, meet for coffee once a
week. During their meetings they have wide-ranging, deep, philosophical
conversations spanning across many important topics.\footnote{For
  instance they ask ``do we all really see green as the same colour?''
  or ``why is it that `q' comes as early in the alphabet as it does? it
  deserves to be with `UVWXYZ'?''} Beyond making progress on some of the
most pressing issues of our time, Charles and Sadie each adore
probability. As a result, at the end of each of their meetings, they
play a game to decide who will pay. The game proceeds by having them
flip a coin three times. If two or more heads come up Charles pays, and
otherwise Sadie pays.

We can think about the strategy that they are using here and \emph{feel}
that this is going to be ``fair''. With two or more heads, Charles pays.
With two or more tails, Sadie pays. There always has to be either two or
more heads \emph{or} two or more tails, and each is equally likely to
come up\footnote{There has been some recent literature, see Bartoš et
  al. (2023), which may suggest that a coin is ever so slightly more
  likely to land on the same side it started on, perhaps undermining
  this assertion.}. The outcome of their game is uncertain before it
begins, but we know that in the long run neither of the friends is going
to be disadvantaged relative to the other. We can say that the
probability that either of them pays is equal. It's 50-50. Everything is
balanced.

Now imagine that one day, in the middle of their game, Charles gets a
very important phone call\footnote{Someone has just pointed out the
  irony in the fact that there is no synonym for synonym. Technically,
  there are the words \emph{metonym} and \emph{poecilonym} and
  \emph{polyonym}, but these are rarely used and Charles would wager
  that there is a very high probability you have never seen them.} and
leaves abruptly after the first coin has been tossed. The first coin
toss showed a heads. Sadie, recognizing the gravity of the phone call,
pays for the both of them, while realizing that Charles was well on the
way to having to pay.

\begin{example}[Basic Probability
Enumeration]\protect\hypertarget{exm-basic-prob}{}\label{exm-basic-prob}

What is the probability that Sadie would have had to pay in the
aforementioned scenario? That is, assuming that the first coin shows a
head, what is the probability that at least two heads are shown on the
first three coin tosses?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Sadie figures that any coin toss is equally likely to show heads or
tails. because the first coin showed heads, then there are four possible
sequences that could have shown up:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(H,H,H\);
\item
  \(H,H,T\);
\item
  \(H,T,H\);
\item
  \(H,T,T\).
\end{enumerate}

In three of these situations ((1) \(H,H,H\), (2) \(H,H,T\), and (3)
\(H,T,H\)) there are two heads and so Charles would have to pay. In one
of them there are two tails, and so Sadie would have to pay. As a
result, Charles would have to pay in \(3\) of the \(4\) (with
probability \(0.75\)) and Sadie in \(1\) of the \(4\) (with probability
\(0.25\)).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Looking at Example~\ref{exm-basic-prob}, we can see that Sadie should
likely have not paid. Only one out of every four times would Sadie have
had to pay, given the first coin being heads. However, we can not be
certain that, had all three tosses been observed, Sadie would \emph{not}
have paid. It is possible that we would have observed two tails, making
her responsible for the bill. This possibility happens one time out of
four, which is more likely than the probability of rolling a four on a
six-sided die\footnote{This event happens one time out of every six.}.
Fours are rolled on six-sided dice quite frequently\footnote{Again,
  about one out of every six rolls}, and so it is not all together
unreasonable for her to have paid.

This seemingly simple concept is the core of probability. Probability
serves as a method for quantifying uncertainty. It allows us to make
numeric statements regarding the set of outcomes that we can observe, by
quantifying the frequency with which we expect to observe those
outcomes. Probability does not \emph{remove} the uncertainty. We still
need to flip the coin or roll the die to know what will happen. All
probability gives us is a set of tools to quantify this uncertainty.
These tools are critical for decision making in the face of the
ever-present uncertainty around us.

\section{How to Interpret Probabilities (like a
Frequentist)}\label{how-to-interpret-probabilities-like-a-frequentist}

We indicated that, intuitively, probability is a measure of the
frequency with which a particular outcome occurs. This intuition can be
codified exactly with the \textbf{Frequentist interpretation} of
probability. According to the Frequentist interpretation (or
frequentism, as it is often called), probabilities correspond to the
proportion of time any event of interest is\footnote{Be that flipping a
  heads, rolling a four, or observing rain on a given day.} actually
occurs in the long run. For a Frequentist, you imagine yourself
performing the experiment you are running over, and over, and over, and
over, and over again. Each time you answer ``did the event happen?'' and
you count up those occurrences. As you do this more and more and more,
wherever that proportion lands corresponds to the probability.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-plot}This plot simulates the repeated tossing of a
coin. The x-axis represents the number of coins being tossed, and the
y-axis plots the proportion of times that heads has shown up
cumulatively over the tosses thus far. We can see in the long run that
this proportion tends towards \(0.5\).}

\centering{

\includegraphics{notes/chapter1_files/figure-pdf/fig-plot-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

To formalize this mathematically, we first define several important
terms.

\begin{definition}[Experiment]\protect\hypertarget{def-experiment}{}\label{def-experiment}

Any action to be performed whose outcome is not (or cannot) be known
with certainty, before it is performed.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Event
{[}Informally{]}]\protect\hypertarget{def-event-inf}{}\label{def-event-inf}

A specified result that may or may not occur when an experiment is
performed.

\end{definition}

Suppose that an experiment is able to be performed as many times as one
likes, limited only by your boredom. If you take \(k_N\) to represent
the number of times that the event of interest occurs when you perform
the experiment \(N\) times, then a Frequentist would define the
probability of the event as
\[\text{probability} = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{k_N}{N}.\] This course
does not assume that you have any familiarity with calculus, and yet,
this definition relies on limits, a concept taken directly from
calculus. However, we will not actually require the ability to work with
limits for this course. Instead, when you see a statement of the form
\[\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x),\] simply think ``what is happening to the
function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) grows and grows (off to \(\infty\))?''

In practice this means that, in order to interpret probabilities, we
think about repeating an experiment many, many times over. As we do
that, we observe the proportion of times that any particular outcome
occurs, and take that to be the defining relation for probabilities. The
reason that we say the probability of flipping a heads is \(0.5\) is
because if we were to sit around and flip a coin\footnote{Our
  experiment.} over, and over, and over again, then in the long-run we
would observe a head\footnote{Our event.} in \(0.5\) of cases.

\begin{example}[Probability
Interpretation]\protect\hypertarget{exm-prob-interp}{}\label{exm-prob-interp}

How do we interpret the statement ``the probability that Sadie would
have had to pay, given a head on the first toss, is \(0.25\)''? Recall
that in the game, they toss three coins, and Sadie pays if two of them
show tails.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

This statement means that, if Sadie were to repeatedly be in the
situation where one head has shown and there are two coins left to toss,
then in \(0.25\) of these situations (in the limit, as this is repeated
an infinite number of times) will end up showing two tails.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Many situations in the real world are not able to be run over and over
again. Think about, for instance, the probability that a particular
candidate wins in a particular election. There is uncertainty there, of
course, but the election can only be run once. What then? There are
several ways through these types of events.

First, we can rely on the \textbf{power of imagination}. There is
nothing stopping us from envisioning the hypothetical possibility of
running the election over, and over, and over, and over again. If we
step outside of reality for a moment, we can ask ``if we could play the
day of the election many, many, many times, what proportion of those
days would end with the candidate being elected?'' If we say that the
candidate has a 75\% chance of being elected, then we mean that in
\(0.75\) of those imagined worlds, the candidate wins. It is crucial to
stress that in our imagination here, we need to be thinking about the
\textbf{exact same day} over and over again. We cannot imagine a
different path leading to the election, different speeches being given
in advance, or different opposition candidates. If we start from the
same place, and play it out many times over, what happens in each of
those worlds?

This repeated imagining is not for everyone. As a result, alternative
proposals to the interpretation of probability have been made. Most
popularly, the \textbf{Bayesian interpretation} has recently become
prominent. To Bayesians, probability is a measure of subjective belief.
To say that there is a \(50\%\) chance of a coin coming up is a
statement about one's knowledge of the world. Typically, coins show up
heads half the time, so that's our belief about heads. The Bayesian
view, built around subjective confidence in the state of the world, can
be formalized mathematically as well. A Bayesian considers the
\emph{prior evidence} that they have about the world\footnote{Any
  relevant evidence that has previously been collected.} and combine
this with current observations in order to update their subject beliefs,
balancing these two sources of information.

\begin{remark}[Bayesian Probabilities and Belief Updating]
Suppose that a Bayesian is flipping a coin. Before any flips have been
made the Bayesian understandably believes that the coin will come up
heads \(50\%\) of the time. However, when the coin starts to be flipped,
the observations are a string of tails in a row.

After having flipped the coin five times, the individual has observed
five tails. Of course, it is totally possible to flip a fair coin five
times and see five tails, but there is a level of skepticism growing.

After 10 flips, the Bayesian has still not seen a head. At this point,
the subjective belief is that there is likely something unfair about
this coin. Even though the experiment started with a baseline assumption
that the coin was fair the Bayesian no longer believes that the next
flip will be a head.

As this goes on, you can imagine the Bayesian continuing to update their
view of the world. To them, the probability is an evolving concept,
capturing what was believed and what has been observed.
\end{remark}

For the election example, the Bayesian interpretation is somewhat easier
to think through. To say that a candidate has a \(75\%\) chance of
winning the election means that ``based on everything that has been
observed, and any prior beliefs about the viability of the candidates,
the subjective likelihood that the candidate wins the election is
\(0.75\)''. If we disagree about prior beliefs, or have experienced
different pieces of information, then we may disagree on the
probability. That is okay.

In this course, we focus on the Frequentist interpretation. This is, in
part, because Frequentist probability is an easier introduction to the
concepts that are necessary for grasping uncertainty. Additionally,
there is some research to suggest that Frequentist interpretations are
fairly well understood by the general public \footnote{See, for instance
  Gigerenzer et al. (2005), where they study how people interpret the
  statement ``there is a \(30\%\) chance of rain tomorrow.''
  Interestingly, most people can convert this into a frequency statement
  (\(3\) out of \(10\), say), even if the specific meaning is sometimes
  lost. They conclude that there are other issues in attempting to
  understanding this statement, issues which we will address later on.}.
However, it is important to know and recognize that there is a world
beyond Frequentist Probability and Statistics, one which can be very
powerful once it is unlocked. \footnote{More on this in later years, if
  you so desire! Come have a chat, if that sounds interesting.}

If probability measures the long term proportion of times that a
particular event occurs, how can we go about computing probabilities? Do
we require to perform an experiment over and over again? Fortunately,
the answer is no. The tools of probability we will cover allow us to
make concrete statements about the probabilities of events without the
need for repeated experimental runs. However, before dismissing the idea
of repeatedly running an experiment at face value, it is worth
considering a tool we have at our disposal that renders this more
possible than it has ever been: computers.

\section{R Programming for Probability and
Statistics}\label{r-programming-for-probability-and-statistics}

Throughout this course we will make use of a programming language for
statistical computing, called R. Classically, introductory statistics
courses involved heavy computation of particular quantities by hand. The
use of a programming language (like R) frees us from the tedium of these
calculations, allowing for a deeper focus on understanding, explanation,
decision-making, and complex problem solving. This is \textbf{not} to
say we will \emph{never} do problems by hand\footnote{To the contrary,
  some amount of by-hand problem solving helps to solidify these
  concepts.}, however, we will emphasize the use of statistical
computing often. While you will not be expected to write R programs on
your own, you will be expected to read simple scripts, make basic
modifications, and to run code that is given to you.

Throughout these course notes, where relevant, R code will be provided
to demonstrate the ideas being discussed. It may be useful to have R
open alongside the notes to ensure that you can get the same results
that are printed throughout. In this section we will cover some of the
very basics of using R, and reading R code. If you are interested, there
are plenty of resources to becoming a more proficient R programmer. This
is a skill that will benefit you not only in this course, but in many
courses to come, and far beyond your university training. If you have
any programming in your background, R is a fairly simple language to
learn; if not, R can be quite beginner friendly.

\subsection{Basic Introduction to R
Programming}\label{basic-introduction-to-r-programming}

When programming, the basic idea is that we are going to write
instructions in a \textbf{script} which we will tell our computer to
execute. These instructions are\footnote{Typically. There are some
  exceptions to this, but if this is your first time programming, you
  need not worry about that!} performed one-by-one, from the top to the
bottom of the script. We can have instructions which operate on their
own, or which interact with previous (or future) instructions to add to
the complexity. The trick with programming then is to determine which
actions you need the computer to perform, in which order, to accomplish
the task that you are setting out to do.

To begin, we may consider a very simple R program, one which uses the
programming language as a basic calculator.

\begin{Shaded}

\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 33554420}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, we ask the computer to perform some simple arithmetic operations.
We use \texttt{+} for addition, \texttt{-} for subtraction, \texttt{*}
for multiplication, \texttt{/} for division, and \texttt{\^{}} for
exponentiation. With the use of parentheses, any expressions relating to
these basic operations can be performed. Note that here the result is
simply output after it is computed. Try modifying the exact expressions
being computed, allowing you to feel comfortable with these types of
mathematical operations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{5} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{3} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ (}\DecValTok{10}\SpecialCharTok{*}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{8}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{25}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}

\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 33554420}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 40}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, we have two lines of math running with simple operations. Each is
simply output when it is computed. These two results have no ability to
interact with one another, and if we were to add more and more lines
beneath, the same would continue to happen. If we want different
commands to be able to interact with one another, we need a method for
storing the results. To do so, we can define \textbf{variables}. In R,
to define a variable, we use the syntax
\texttt{variable\_name\ \textless{}-\ variable\_value}. We can choose
\emph{almost} anything that we want for the variable name\footnote{The
  variable name must start with a letter and can be a combination of
  letters, numbers, periods, and underscore.} and the variable value can
also be of many types.\footnote{more on this later} The arrow between
the two is the \textbf{assignment operator} and it simply tells R to
assign the \texttt{variable\_value} to be accessible from the
\texttt{variable\_name}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{my\_8 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\NormalTok{my\_5}
\NormalTok{my\_8}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 5}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this code we assign the variable \texttt{my\_5} to contain the value
5, and the variable \texttt{my\_8} to contain the value 8. We can output
these as expressions themselves, simply by typing the variable name.
Simply outputting these variables is not of particular interest,
however, we can use the variables in later statements by simply
including the variable name in them.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{my\_8 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\NormalTok{my\_5}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{my\_8}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 40}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, instead of simply outputting the variables, we multiply them
together. We could have used \texttt{5\ *\ 8} in this case for the same
result, however, we are afforded a lot more flexibility with this
approach. Much of this flexibility comes from our capacity to
\emph{change} the values of variables over time. Consider the following
script, and try to understand why the output is the way that it is.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{my\_8 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\NormalTok{my\_5}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{my\_8}

\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{my\_5}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{my\_8}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 40}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 80}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

At the top point in the script, before the first \texttt{my\_5*my\_8}
call, The variable \texttt{my\_5} has the value \texttt{5}. However,
after this is called, the value is updated to be \texttt{10}. Then, when
we call \texttt{my\_5*my\_8} again, this is now simplified to
\texttt{10\ *\ 8}, giving the result. Perhaps more importantly, we can
take the value of an expression and assign that to a variable itself.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{my\_8 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\NormalTok{result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ my\_5}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{my\_8}
\NormalTok{result }
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 40}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, we define another variable. This time, \texttt{result} now
contains the result of multiplying our previous two variables. Thus,
when we output it, we get the same value. Take a moment to read through
the following script, and try to understand what will happen at the end.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{my\_8 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{8}
\NormalTok{result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ my\_5}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{my\_8}

\NormalTok{my\_5 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ result}
\NormalTok{my\_8 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ my\_5}
\NormalTok{result }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ my\_5 }\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ my\_8}

\NormalTok{result }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The result is 1600. Why? We can read through this step-by-step in order
to understand this. First we set our variables to have the values of
\texttt{5} and \texttt{8}. Then, \texttt{result} is made to be the
product of our two variables, which in this case is \texttt{40}. After
that, we set the value of \texttt{my\_5} to be the same as the value of
\texttt{result}, which gives \texttt{my\_5} equal to \texttt{40}. At
this point, \texttt{result} equals \texttt{40}, \texttt{my\_5} equals
\texttt{40}, and \texttt{my\_8} is equal to \texttt{8}. The next line
updates \texttt{my\_8} to be the same as the value of \texttt{my\_5},
which we just clarified was \texttt{40}. As a result, all of the
variables we have defined now take on the value of \texttt{40}. The
final line before output, \texttt{result\ \textless{}-\ my\_5\ *\ my\_8}
updates the value of \texttt{result} to be the product of the two
variables again, this time giving \texttt{40\ *\ 40} which gives 1600.

\subsection{Function Calls in R}\label{function-calls-in-r}

Up until this point we have simply used numerical operations and
variable assignment. While this allows R to serve as a very powerful
calculator, we often want computers to do much more than arithmetic. As
a result, we need to explore \textbf{functions} in R. A function is a
piece of code which takes in various arguments and outputs some value
(or values). Most of the way that we will use R in this course is
through the use of function calls.\footnote{Note: when you begin to
  write programs for yourself, a lot of your time will be spent writing
  custom functions. If this is of interest to you, I suggest looking
  into programming more! For this course we will not need to define our
  own functions, except perhaps ones that will be defined for you.} This
is exactly analogous to a mathematical function: it is simply some rule
which maps input to output. In fact, some of the most basic functions in
R are functions which relate to mathematical functions.

\(\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{10}\).
\item[\circled{3}]
Computes the natural logarithm of \texttt{x}, that is
\(\log(x) = \log(10)\).
\end{description}

The basic format of a function call will always be
\texttt{function\_name(param1,\ param2,\ ...)}. Each of these functions
required only a single parameter, however, there are some functions
which take more than one parameter. If we have decimal numbers, for
instance, we may wish to round them. To do so, we can use the
\texttt{round} function in R, which takes two parameters: the number we
wish to round, and how many digits we wish to keep.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{unrounded\_value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FloatTok{3.141592}
\NormalTok{rounded\_value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{round}\NormalTok{(unrounded\_value, }\AttributeTok{digits =} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{rounded\_value}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 3.142}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are a few things to note about this sequence of function calls.
First, note that we assign the output of a function to a new variable.
This behaves exactly as we saw above with simple numeric calculations.
Next, consider that the output of the function\footnote{Which we have
  stored in the variable \texttt{rounded\_value}} has a value of
\(3.142\). That is: we rounded the value to \(3\) decimal points,
exactly as would be expected. The final part to note is that the second
parameter passed to the function call is \textbf{named}. That is,
instead of simply calling \texttt{round(unrounded\_value,\ 3)}, we have
\texttt{round(unrounded\_value,\ digits\ =\ 3)}. If you had made the
first call this would have worked perfectly.\footnote{Try it out to
  convince yourself!} However, R also provides the ability to pass in
parameter names alongside the parameter values with the syntax
\texttt{function\_name(param\_name\ =\ param\_value,\ ...)}. The benefit
to doing this is two-fold. First, it is easier to read what is
happening, especially for function calls that you have never seen
before. Second, it removes the need to have the parameters ordered
correctly. It is best practice to \textbf{always} include parameter
names where you can.

Now, you may be wondering ``how do you know what the parameter names
should be?'' The names are built-in to the different functions that you
are working with and so overtime you will become quite familiar with
them. However, at any point you can also run the command
\texttt{?function\_name}, replacing \texttt{function\_name} with the
name of a function you are interested in, to open documentation about
that function. There you will see not only the names of the different
parameters, but useful information regarding what the function does,
examples of how to call it, and so forth.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{?round}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When we run this code, we are given \emph{a lot} of information. We can
see the function name, the details, how it's called, and so forth. In
the \textbf{Arguments} section we get a list of all of the arguments we
can pass to the function, along with a description of them. In this case
we see that \texttt{round} can take a parameter called \texttt{x} for
the number to be rounded, and \texttt{digits} (which we have previously
seen).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{unrounded\_value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FloatTok{3.141592}
\NormalTok{rounded\_value }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{round}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{digits =} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ unrounded\_value)}

\NormalTok{rounded\_value}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 3.142}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This code produces the exact same output, where now both parameters are
named. Specifically, we could read this function call as ``round the
value of \texttt{x} to have \texttt{digits} decimal points.'' If you had
instead written \texttt{round(3,\ unrounded\_value)}, you would get the
value \texttt{3}, since now we are rounding \texttt{3} to
\texttt{3.141592} decimal points.

\subsection{Moving Beyond Numeric
Data}\label{moving-beyond-numeric-data}

So far, everything that we have looked at has been numeric data. We have
seen integers, and decimals. You can have negative results, say by
taking \texttt{my\_var\ \textless{}-\ -5}. And while numbers are
frequently useful, we will require further types of data to write useful
computer programs. For this course we will focus on three additional
data types: textual data which (referred to as \textbf{strings}), true
and false binary data (referred to as \textbf{booleans}), and lists of
the same data type (referred to as \textbf{vectors}). They will behave
in much the same way as numeric data, with different functions and
techniques which can be applied to them.

To define a string of text, we simply encapsulate the text that we are
interested in within quotation marks (either single
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}} or double \texttt{"} quotation marks will
work).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{first\_string }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"This is a string."}
\NormalTok{second\_string }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}This is also a string.\textquotesingle{}}

\NormalTok{first\_string}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] "This is a string."}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Two commonly used functions which rely on strings are \texttt{paste} and
\texttt{print}. Each will take in strings as input, and they do not need
to be named. The function \texttt{paste} can take in as many strings as
you would like. It will ``paste'' together all the strings provided,
creating a longer string out of these. The function \texttt{print} will
display the string that is passed as output. Until now we have been
running these programs in a way where all calls are displayed as output:
this will not always be the case, and so print can come in handy there.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_greeting }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"Hello! Welcome to R programming,"}
\NormalTok{my\_name }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"Dylan"}

\NormalTok{combined\_string }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{paste}\NormalTok{(my\_greeting, my\_name, }\StringTok{"!"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(combined\_string)}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] "Hello! Welcome to R programming, Dylan !"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that \texttt{paste} has several additional options which can be
investigated in the documentation for \texttt{paste}. This is only the
simplest use case for it. In general, strings are particularly helpful
when we wish to have output from the computer that will be human
readable. Where strings are largely for humans, booleans are largely for
computers.

Much of what computer programming entails is checking whether certain
conditions hold, and then taking different actions depending on what is
found. In order to do this, the computer needs a way to represent true
and false statements. In R, these are codified with the values
\texttt{TRUE} and \texttt{FALSE}. Note, the capital letters here make a
difference. You cannot use \texttt{true} or \texttt{True} or any other
combination thereof. More important than simply being able to specify
the values \texttt{TRUE} and \texttt{FALSE} directly is the ability to
detect whether certain statements are \texttt{TRUE} or \texttt{FALSE}.
For this we require comparison operators.

If we think of mathematical comparisons we can state whether two things
are equal, or not equal, and whether one thing is less than (or equal
to) or greater than (or equal to) another. We can run all of these same
checks in R.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To check whether two quantities are equal you use
  \texttt{quantity\_1\ ==\ quantity\_2}. This statement will be
  \texttt{TRUE} if \texttt{quantity\_1} and \texttt{quantity\_2} are
  exactly the same, and will be \texttt{FALSE} otherwise.
\item
  To check whether two quantities are not equal, you can use
  \texttt{quantity\_1\ !=\ quantity\_2}. This statement will be
  \texttt{TRUE} if the quantities differ from one another.
\item
  To check whether one quantity is larger than another, you can use
  \texttt{quantity\_1\ \textgreater{}\ quantity\_2}. If you want to know
  whether it is greater than \emph{or} equal to, you can use
  \texttt{quantity\_1\ \textgreater{}=\ quantity\_2}.
\item
  To check whether one quantity is smaller than another, you can use
  \texttt{quantity\_1\ \textless{}\ quantity\_2}. If you want to know
  whether it is less than \emph{or} equal to, you can use
  \texttt{quantity\_1\ \textless{}=\ quantity\_2}.
\end{itemize}

There are two key points to note beyond this. First, we will of course
not normally compare two constants to one another. We already know that
\texttt{5==5} and so we would not need to check it. We can, however,
plug-in variables, perhaps with unknown values, and have the same types
of statements being made. Second, the checks for equality and inequality
also work with other data types (like strings).

The final checks may be slightly odd. Here we are comparing across
different types of data. When we do this R will automatically try to
convert from one type to the other. With strings and numbers this is not
too challenging. If they can be converted nicely between types, then
they are and the values are compared. Otherwise, R will conclude they
are not equal by default. For booleans, it is important to note that
\texttt{TRUE\ ==\ 1} and \texttt{FALSE\ ==\ 0}. We will often use these
values interchangeably.

The final data type that we will consider are vectors. Vectors store
many different values, of the same type, in a single object. Thus, we
may have a vector of numeric data, or a vector of strings, or a vector
of booleans. The vectors will always contain the same type throughout,
but they are stored in a single object (and as such, for instance, can
be stored in a single variable). To define a vector we call
\texttt{c(...)}, where the \texttt{...} contains the set of objects we
want to store in the vector. The \texttt{c} stands for
\textbf{c}oncatenate, as we are \emph{concatenating} together the set of
items into a single container.

We see that each of these vectors holds one type of object. Vectors can
be of arbitrary and different lengths. It is also possible to combine
multiple vectors \emph{of the same type} into one, by using the
\texttt{c} function again.

Here we combine different numeric vectors together. We also show, when
forming \texttt{combined\_v3}, how numeric vectors can have single items
added onto them. That is, if you have a single number, it can be treated
as a vector with one element in it. This becomes very useful when
building up vectors within code. In addition to combining multiple
vectors together, we can also select elements out of a vector. To do
this, we use a set of square brackets after the vector's name, with a
number within those square brackets specifying the \textbf{index} of the
vector we are interested in. The index is simply the element position
starting at 1\footnote{If you have programmed in the past there is a
  good chance the language you have learned is ``0 indexed'' rather than
  ``1 indexed''. In R, all vectors start at position 1 and count up,
  which is not the case in many languages. Be careful of this.} and
running to the length of the vector. We can include a vector of indices
to select multiple elements at once.

Note that, each element is selectable individually, giving a single item
of that type (in this case, strings). If you select multiple of the
elements together, it will create a vector of that type (in this case, a
string vector). Note that in addition to selecting elements in this way
by their indices, you can also update the elements in the same way.

In this example we are changing the last element of the vector.
Sometimes we may not know how long the vector actually is, if for
instance, it is being built-up as our code runs. If we ever want to
check the length of a vector, we can simply call the function
\texttt{length} which takes as input only one vector, and outputs the
numeric value of its length.

\subsection{Program Control Flow}\label{program-control-flow}

We have seen different types of data, different ways of manipulating
data, functions, and variables so far. In order to bring all of these
concepts together into useful programs we need some way to control the
flow of our programs. We have seen that, by default, programs execute
from the top until the bottom. However, it will often be the case that
we want want to have certain code running only if certain conditions
hold, or that we want to repeat some piece of code many times over. To
accomplish these tasks we require \textbf{control flow statements}. We
will consider only two types of control flow statements now, which will
serve well enough to read most of what needs to be read for this course.

The first type of statement is the \textbf{conditional statement}.
Conditional statements execute only when certain conditions hold. The
simplest conditional statement is an \textbf{if} statement. The format
to define an if statement if \texttt{if\ (condition)\{\ ...\ \}}, where
\texttt{condition} is some logical condition to be evaluated. If the
condition is \texttt{TRUE} then the code contained in \{ \ldots{} \} is
evaluated. If the condition is \texttt{FALSE} it is not.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_number }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{5}

\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{) \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a positive."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}

\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{) \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a negative."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] "My number is a positive."}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this case, these simple conditional statement check to see whether
the number we entered is larger than zero and whether the number we
entered is smaller than zero, respectively. When run, notice that only
one of the statements is executed.\footnote{In fact, if
  \texttt{my\_number} is set to \texttt{0} then none of the statements
  are executed.} In this case, we know that only one (or neither) of
these statements can be true. When that is the case it may make sense to
make use of \texttt{else} clauses in our conditional logic.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_number }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{5}

\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{) \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a positive."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{ \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is not a positive."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] "My number is not a positive."}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, \emph{if} the number is greater than \texttt{0}, then we run the
first block of code, \emph{otherwise} we run the second block of code.
Thus, whenever a positive number is entered, we see ``My number is a
positive'', and whenever a non-positive number is entered, we see ``My
number is not a positive.'' We can extend \texttt{else} blocks to be
\texttt{else\ if} blocks, where further conditions can be specified.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_number }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{100}

\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{) \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a large positive value."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)\{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a small positive value."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{) \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a large negative value."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(my\_number }\SpecialCharTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{) \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is a small negative value."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{ \{}
    \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"My number is zero."}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] "My number is a large positive value."}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In these case we can simply pass through each conditional statement in
order. First, is the number larger than \texttt{50}? If so, print the
statement, otherwise we check the next condition, is the number greater
than \texttt{0}? Note that if we are checking this condition we
\emph{know} that the number is less than or equal to \texttt{50} since
it failed the first check. We continue through the rest of this
procedure down until the last else block. This block is run only when
all of the other conditions fail: that is, our value is not larger than
\texttt{50}, or larger than \texttt{0}, or smaller than \texttt{-50}, or
smaller than \texttt{0}. The only value that satisfies this is
\texttt{0} itself.

Sometimes, we wish to check compound conditions. That is, we want to
know whether multiple conditions hold, or perhaps, whether at least one
of many conditions hold. These statements can be converted into ``and''
and ``or'' statements, respectively. To denote ``and'' statements we use
\texttt{\&\&} and to denote ``or'' statements we use
\texttt{\textbar{}\textbar{}}. Thus, the check
\texttt{my\_val\ \textgreater{}\ 0\ \&\&\ my\_val\ \textless{}\ 100}
returns true only if \texttt{my\_val} is both above \texttt{0}
\textbf{and} below 100. The check
\texttt{my\_val\ \textless{}\ -50\ \textbar{}\textbar{}\ my\_val\ \textgreater{}\ 50}
returns true whenever \textbf{either} \texttt{my\_val} is less than
\texttt{-50} \textbf{or} \texttt{my\_val} is greater than \texttt{50}.

\end{Shaded}

Conditional statements can grow to be very complex, however, with these
rules you can read through them top-to-bottom, substituting for ``and''
and ``or'' where necessary. It is also possible, where required, to
place one conditional statement inside the code block for another, and
to combine them with any of the other techniques that we have learned
thus far.

The final piece of control flow that we will consider for now is the
\texttt{for} loop. The idea with a \texttt{for} loop is that we want to
repeat the same action either a certain number of times, or for every
item in a set of items. To do so, we use the syntax
\texttt{for(x\ in\ vector)\{...\}}, where the code in \texttt{...} will
be performed once for every single item in the vector. Within the code
block specified by \texttt{...}, the value \texttt{x} will take on the
current value in the loop.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\DocumentationTok{\#\# [1] 3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice that three values are printed, in order, \texttt{1} then
\texttt{2} then \texttt{3}. The loop code is run three different times,
one for each element in the list. Each time the loop is running the next
value from the list gets assigned to the variable \texttt{x}. The first
time it runs it gets the first element, and so forth. As a result, we
can use these values in our calculations in whatever way we need to.

Whenever we are trying to form a numeric vector with consecutive
elements, as we are in \texttt{c(1,2,3)}, we can make this easier on
ourselves by simply specifying the upper and lower bounds of the range,
separated by a colon. That is \texttt{c(1,2,3)\ ==\ 1:3}. This is often
useful when specify a loop as we very often want to repeat something a
set number of times. Note that we do not ever \emph{need} to use the
value of the looping variable. Sometimes, we just want things to repeat,
and so the loop is a convenient way to do that.

\subsection{Reading Through a More Complex R
Program}\label{reading-through-a-more-complex-r-program}

Take a moment to read through the following R program and try to
understand what is happening exactly. There are comments throughout
which will assist in the parsing of the script. We have seen comments up
until now, without drawing explicit attention to them. In R, anything
placed after a \texttt{\#} on the line is considered a comment. The
programming language ignores these and so they are only there to help
other individuals who may be reading through. It is good practice to
comment your code to help others, and also to help yourself whenever you
return to it in the future. In the course notes code will typically be
commented. If you are reading the PDF version of the notes often these
comments will be annotations beside the code (numbering certain lines)
with the comments provided below, for the sake of legibility.

Note, this combines everything that we have learned, and it is entirely
understandable if it takes some time to process. Fortunately, you can
always try running the script yourself, and playing with different
components of it. Remember, if you do not know what a function call
does, you can use the documentation\footnote{The internet is also a
  wonderful resource, one which even very experienced developers make
  frequent use of.} and try playing with it some yourself. To help with
the interpretation here, note that this is an implementation of the game
that Charles and Sadie have been playing.

\subsection{R Programming for Probability
Interpretations}\label{r-programming-for-probability-interpretations}

Recall that the motivation for the discussion of R was the Frequentist
interpretation of probability. One task that computers are very
effective at is repeatedly performing some action. As a result, we can
use computers to mimic the idea of repeatedly performing an experiment.
Consider the simple case of flipping a coin over and over again.

We can use \texttt{sample(x,\ size)} as a function to select
\texttt{size} realizations from the set contained in \texttt{x}. Thus,
if we take \texttt{sample(x\ =\ c("H","T"),\ size=1)} we can view this
as flipping a coin one time. If we use the loop structure we talked
before, then we can simulate the experience of repeatedly flipping a
coin. Consider the following R code. Note, any time that we are doing
something which is randomized in R (such as drawing random samples) we
also will make use of the \texttt{set.seed()} function. This function
takes in an integer value as an argument, and by providing the
\emph{same} integer value we can make sure to always get the same random
numbers generated.\footnote{Technically, we cannot use a computer to
  generate random numbers. We can only generate \emph{pseudo random}
  numbers, which are close enough for most purposes.} This helps to
ensure the repeatability of any R analysis, and it is good practice to
do. To see what happens without seeding, try modifying the following
code without a seed, and running it several times. Then, set the seed
(to any number you like) and do the same process.

It is worth adjusting some of the parameters within the simulation, and
seeing what happens. What if you ran the experiment only 5 times? Ten
thousand times? What if instead of counting the number of heads, we
wanted to count the number of tails? What if we wanted to count the
number of times that a six-sided die rolled a 4? All of these settings
can be investigated with simple modifications to the provided script.

\chapter{The Mathematical Foundations of Statistical
Experiments}\label{the-mathematical-foundations-of-statistical-experiments}

\section{The Sample Space and Events}\label{the-sample-space-and-events}

While we gave the mathematical formulation for the Frequentist
interpretation of probability, we will typically require a more detailed
mathematical model to work with probabilities. We want a description,
framed in terms of mathematical objects, which will allow us to work out
the probabilities of interest. In general, to form such a probability
model we need both a list of all possible outcomes that the experiment
can produce, as well as the probabilities of these outcomes.

We call the list of outcomes that can occur from an experiment the
\textbf{sample space} of the experiment. The sample space is denoted
\(\mathcal{S}\), and is defined as the set of all possible outcomes from
the experiment. For instance, if the experiment is flipping a coin we
have \(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\}\). If the experiment is
rolling a six-sided die then \(\mathcal{S} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\).

\begin{definition}[Sample
Space]\protect\hypertarget{def-sample-space}{}\label{def-sample-space}

The sample space of a statistical experiment is the set of all possible
outcomes that can be realized from that experiment. The sample space is
typically denoted \(\mathcal{S}\), or with similar script letters.

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Enumerating Sample
Spaces]\protect\hypertarget{exm-sample-space-basic}{}\label{exm-sample-space-basic}

Write down the complete sample space, \(\mathcal{S}\) for the game that
Sadie and Charles play, based on flipping and observing a coin three
times in sequence.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

For Sadie and Charles their experiment involves tossing a coin three
times in sequence. As a result each outcome is a three-dimensional list
of values, given for instance by \((\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\). As a
result, we can write down the full sample space as
\[\mathcal{S} = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{T})\}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

With the sample space formally defined, we can revisit
Definition~\ref{def-event-inf}, and formally define the concept of an
event.

\begin{definition}[Event]\protect\hypertarget{def-event}{}\label{def-event}

An event is any collection of outcomes from a sample space for a
statistical experiment. Mathematically, an event, \(E\), is a subset of
\(\mathcal{S}\), and we write \(E\subset\mathcal{S}\).

\end{definition}

Take for instance the experiment of a single coin. In this case,
\(E_1 = \{\text{H}\}\), \(E_2 = \{\text{T}\}\), and
\(E_3 = \{\text{H},\text{T}\}\) are examples of possible events. Here,
\(E_1\) corresponds to the event that a head is observed, \(E_2\)
corresponds to the event that a tail is observed, and \(E_3\)
corresponds to the event that either a tails or a heads was observed.
Note that for each event we have \(E_1 \subset \mathcal{S}\),
\(E_2 \subset \mathcal{S}\), and \(E_3 \subseteq \mathcal{S}\).

\begin{example}[Basic Event
Listing]\protect\hypertarget{exm-basic-events}{}\label{exm-basic-events}

List several events from the game that Charles and Sadie are playing.
Indicate why these are events.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Recall that an event is any subset of the sample space. In
Example~\ref{exm-sample-space-basic} we define \(\mathcal{S}\) for this
game. As a result we can take sets which contain any combinations of
these elements. For instance \(E_1 = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\}\),
or
\(E_2 = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H})\}\),
or
\[E_3 = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{T})\}.\]
These are all events since \(E_1 \subset \mathcal{S}\),
\(E_2 \subset \mathcal{S}\), and \(E_3 \subset \mathcal{S}\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[Event
Identification]\protect\hypertarget{exm-event-identification}{}\label{exm-event-identification}

Is ``Charles has to pay'' an event from the game that Charles and Sadie
are playing? Why?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

No.~``Charles has to pay'' is not an event as it is not a subset of the
sample space. This could plausibly be seen as a real-world description
of a possible event, but it is not \emph{itself} an event.
\footnotemark{}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{As time goes on we will become less strict about this
language. When speaking to a statistician, they would understand
``Charles has to pay'' as an event that \emph{can} occur based on the
defined sample space, by simply transforming it into the language of the
sample space. However, the distinction is important to make: events are
always subsets of the sample space. Once this is second nature, it is a
rule that can be loosened, as the knowledge can always be fallen back on
when needed. Simply put: you need to know the rules in order to break
them!}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[Defining Events from Real-World
Descriptions]\protect\hypertarget{exm-event-conversion}{}\label{exm-event-conversion}

What event corresponds to the description ``Charles has to pay'' in the
game that Charles and Sadie are playing? Recall that they flip a coin
three times, and Charles will pay if at least two heads come up, while
Sadie will pay if at least two tails come up.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Charles will have to pay whenever there are two or more heads. As a
result we can enumerate the possible outcomes that leads to Charles
paying. We have

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \((\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\);
\item
  \((\text{T},\text{H},\text{H})\);
\item
  \((\text{H},\text{T},\text{H})\);
\item
  \((\text{H},\text{H},\text{T})\).
\end{enumerate}

Any other outcome will have fewer than two heads, and as a result,
Charles will not have to pay. Thus, to form an event, we consider the
set with each of these outcomes in it. This gives
\[E = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T})\}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

While the events \(E_1 = \{\text{H}\}\) and \(E_2 = \{\text{T}\}\) each
correspond to a simple outcome from the sample space,
\(E_3 = \{\text{H},\text{T}\}\) corresponds to a combined event. We call
direct outcomes \textbf{simple events} and more complex outcomes like
\(E_3\) \textbf{compound events}.

\begin{definition}[Simple
Event]\protect\hypertarget{def-simple-event}{}\label{def-simple-event}

A simple event is any event which corresponds to exactly one outcome
from the sample space. A simple event only has one way of occurring. The
size of the set for a simple event will be \(1\). The sample space, in
turn, is made up of a collection of simple events.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Compound
Event]\protect\hypertarget{def-compound-event}{}\label{def-compound-event}

A compound event is any event which corresponds to more than one outcome
from the sample space. A compound event can occur in multiple different
ways. The size of the set for the compound event will be greater than
\(1\).

\end{definition}

If we consider rolling a six-sided die, then an example of a simple
event is that a four shows up, denoted \(\{4\}\). A compound event could
be that an even number is rolled, \(\{2,4,6\}\), or that a number
greater than or equal to four is rolled, \(\{4, 5, 6\}\).

\begin{example}[Identifying Simple and Compound
Events]\protect\hypertarget{exm-simple-versus-compound}{}\label{exm-simple-versus-compound}

List an example of (at least) one simple and one compound event from the
game that Charles and Sadie are playing.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

An example of a simple event would be
\(E_1 = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\}\) since it is comprised of
exactly one outcome. If three heads are rolled, this event occurs, there
is no other way for it to occur. An example of a compound event would be
\[E_2 = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T})\}.\]
Here there are four outcomes that correspond to this event, and if any
of those outcomes are observed the event occurs.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

We say that an event ``occurs'' if any of the outcomes comprising the
event occur. As a result we can have more than one event occurring as
the result of a run of a statistical experimental. Suppose that we are
rolling a fair, six-sided die. Consider the events ``an even number was
rolled'' and ``a number greater than or equal to four was rolled.'' If a
four or a six are rolled, both of these events happen simultaneously.
Our goal when working with probability will be to assign probability
values to different events. We will talk about how likely, or unlikely,
events of interest are, given the underlying statistical experiment.

Above, we defined \(E_3\) to be equal to \(\mathcal{S}\). As a result,
we can say that \(\mathcal{S}\) \emph{is} an event since
\(\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{S}\). This is the event that any
outcome is observed, which is certain to happen. Since it is certain to
happen, we know it happens with probability \(1\). There is another
``special'' event which is important to consider. We call this the
\emph{null event}. Denote \(\emptyset\), the null event is an event that
corresponds to ``nothing in the sample space''. We know that every time
an experiment is run something in the sample space occurs, and so the
null event is assigned probability zero.

\begin{definition}[Null
Event]\protect\hypertarget{def-null-event}{}\label{def-null-event}

The null event, denoted \(\emptyset\) or \(\{\}\), is an event from a
statistical experiment which corresponds to nothing within the sample
space. The null event has probability zero, and it is impossible to
observe. Note that, no matter the sample space,
\(\emptyset\subset\mathcal{S}\).

\end{definition}

\section{Set Operations for Event
Manipulation}\label{set-operations-for-event-manipulation}

Ultimately, we think of all events as being sets. These sets are subsets
of the sample space, and can contain single or multiple outcomes. Every
quantity that we are interested in can be expressed as some set of
outcomes of interest. In building up these sets it is common to
construct through the use of ``and'', ``or'', and ``not'' statements.
That is, we may say that our event occurs if some outcome \textbf{OR}
another outcome occurs, or perhaps our outcomes occurs if some outcome
does \textbf{NOT} occur.\footnote{While both \emph{or} and \emph{not}
  language is likely clear from the examples we have seen so far,
  \emph{and} language may be slightly less obvious. While we will
  explore this in more depth shortly, note that you could not have two
  simple events occurring simultaneously. If \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are
  both simple events, then you can have \(E_1\) \textbf{or} \(E_2\), and
  you can have \textbf{not} \(E_1\), but you cannot have \(E_1\)
  \textbf{and} \(E_2\). This is \emph{not} true for compound events.}

Consider the example of drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck. In
such a deck there are 13 card ranks, and four card suits, with one of
each combination present. If we draw a single card we can think of the
outcomes of the experiment as being any of the 52 possible combinations
of rank and suit. We are often interested in an event such as ``the card
is red'', which is the same as saying ``the card is a heart \textbf{or}
the card is a diamond.'' Perhaps we want to know whether the card was an
ace through ten, this is the same as saying ``the card is \textbf{not} a
Jack \textbf{or} a Queen \textbf{or} a King.'' If we are interested in
the event that the ace of spades was drawn, this can be expressed by
saying that ``the card was a spade \textbf{and} the card was an ace.''

As you begin to pay attention to the linguistic representation of events
that we use, you will notice more and more the use of these words to
form compound events in particular. As a result, we give each of them a
mathematical operation which allow us to quickly and compactly express
these quantities in notation.

\begin{example}[Description of
Events]\protect\hypertarget{exm-linguistic-description}{}\label{exm-linguistic-description}

Describe ``Charles has to pay'', based on the game Charles and Sadie are
playing, using language revolving around ``or'', ``and'', and ``not''
each. That is, describe observing at least two heads, on three flips of
a coin, one time using ``or'', one time using ``and'', and one time
using ``not''.\footnote{It may be helpful to notice that you can mix and
  match these terms to your hearts content!}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

There are plausibly many possible ways of doing so. Consider the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{OR}: Two heads are observed OR three heads are observed.
\item
  \textbf{AND}: Not two tails are observed AND not three tails are
  observed.
\item
  \textbf{NOT}: Not more than one tails are observed.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

We define mathematical operations to encapsulate the use of \textbf{or},
\textbf{and}, and \textbf{not}. These operations apply to any
mathematical sets, whether they refer to events or not.

\begin{definition}[Union]\protect\hypertarget{def-union}{}\label{def-union}

The union encodes the use of ``or'' in reference to two or more sets.
Formally, with two sets \(A\) and \(B\), the union of \(A\) and \(B\) is
the set of all elements that are contained in \(A\), or \(B\), or both
\(A\) and \(B\). We write \(A \cup B\) and read that as \(A\) union
\(B\). When we wish to take the union of many sets,
\(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\), we write this as \[\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i.\]

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Intersection]\protect\hypertarget{def-intersection}{}\label{def-intersection}

The intersection captures the use of ``and'' in reference to two or more
sets. Formally, the intersection of two sets, \(A\), and \(B\), is the
set that contains all elements that belong to both \(A\) and \(B\). We
write \(A \cap B\), and say ``\(A\) intersect \(B\).'' When we wish to
take the union of many sets, \(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\), we write
\[\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i.\]

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complement]\protect\hypertarget{def-complement}{}\label{def-complement}

The complement makes formal the concept of ``not.'' The complement of a
set is the set of all elements which occur in the sample space but are
not in the given set. We write this as \(A^C\) and say ``\(A\)
complement.'' When dealing with a sample space, \(\mathcal{S}\), the
complement of \(A\) is the set of all elements in \(\mathcal{S}\) that
are not in \(A\).

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Basic Set
Operations]\protect\hypertarget{exm-basic-set-operations}{}\label{exm-basic-set-operations}

For the game being played by Charles and Sadie, take
\(E_1 = \{(\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{H})\}\),
\(E_2 = \{(\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{H}), (\text{T}, \text{H}, \text{H}), (\text{H}, \text{T}, \text{H})\}\),
and \(E_3 = \{(\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{T})\}\). Express the following
events.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(E_1 \cup E_2\);
\item
  \(E_1 \cap E_2\);
\item
  \(E_2^C\);
\item
  \(E_2 \cap E_3\);
\item
  \(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Directly from definitions we can write down each of the following sets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \[E_1 \cup E_2 =  \{(\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{H}), (\text{T}, \text{H}, \text{H}), (\text{H}, \text{T}, \text{H})\} = E_2.\]
  As a result, the union of \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) is simply
  \(E_2\).\footnotemark{}
\item
  \[E_1 \cap E_2 = \{(\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{H})\} = E_1.\] As a
  result, the intersection of \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) is simply
  \(E_1\).\footnotemark{}
\item
  \[E_2^C =  \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{T})\}.\]
\item
  For \(E_2\cap E_3\) note that they share no elements. As a result, the
  intersection will be empty since there are no elements common to both
  of them. This gives \(E_2\cap E_3 = \emptyset\).
\item
  \[E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3 = \{(\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{H}), (\text{T}, \text{H}, \text{H}), (\text{H}, \text{T}, \text{H}), (\text{H}, \text{H}, \text{T})\}.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Note that whenever we have two events, \(A\) and \(B\),
with \(A\subset B\), then \(A\cup B = B\).}

\footnotetext{Note that whenever we have two events, \(A\) and \(B\),
with \(A\subset B\) then \(A \cap B = A\).}

\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Disjoint
Events]\protect\hypertarget{def-disjoint-events}{}\label{def-disjoint-events}

Two events, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are said to be disjoint whenever their
intersection is the null event. That is, if \(E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset\)
then \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are disjoint events.

\end{definition}

These concepts allow us to more compactly express sets of interest, and
in particular, will be quite useful when it comes to assigning
probability. The more times you work with the set operations, the more
familiar they will become, and as a result, practice is always useful.
Considering rolling a 6-sided die, and take \(A\) to be the event that a
\(6\) is rolled, \(B\) to be the event that the roll was at least \(5\),
\(C\) to be the event that the roll was less than \(4\), and \(D\) to be
the event that the roll was odd.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we consider \(D^C\) this is the event that the roll was even;
\item
  \(A \cup C\) is the event that a \(6\) was rolled or that a number
  less than \(4\) was rolled, which is to say anything other than a
  \(4\) or a \(5\);
\item
  If we take \(A \cup B\) then this will be the same as \(B\), and
  \(A\cap B\) will be \(A\).
\item
  If we take the event \(A\cap C\), notice that no outcomes satisfy both
  conditions, and so \(A \cap C = \emptyset\).
\item
  We can also join together multiple operations. \(D^C \cap C\) gives us
  even numbers than less than \(4\), which is to say the outcome \(2\).
\item
  Similarly, \((A \cap B)^C\) would represent the event that a number
  less than \(6\) is rolled.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Set Operations with Decks of
Cards]\protect\hypertarget{exm-card-set-operations}{}\label{exm-card-set-operations}

Charles and Sadie are tiring of flipping their coin, and so they wish to
start using decks of cards sometimes instead. Before they formalize a
game based on decks of cards, they want to make sure that they are both
very comfortable working with these. Suppose that the sample space is
defined to be the set of \(52\) standard cards that may be drawn on a
single draw. Describe how set operations can be used to form events
corresponding to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A red card is observed.
\item
  Any card between an ace and a ten is observed.
\item
  The ace of spades is observed.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

First, we define several events. Note, these can be defined in shorthand
to prevent needing to write out many different cards. we take \(D\) to
be the event that a diamond is observed, we take \(H\) to be the event
that a heart is observed, take \(S\) to be the event that a spade is
observed\footnotemark{} and then take \(A\) to be the event that an ace
is observed, \(J\) to be the event that a Jack is observed, \(Q\) to be
the event that a Queen is observed, and \(K\) to be the event that a
King is observed\footnotemark{} then we can use unions, intersections,
and complements to express the previously mentioned scenarios.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  To represent outcomes corresponding to ``the card is red'', we can use
  \(D \cup H\).
\item
  To represent outcomes corresponding to ``an ace through ten'', we can
  use \((J \cup Q \cup K)^C\).
\item
  To represent the outcome ``the ace of spades'', we may use
  \(A \cap S\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Note, these three are compound events with \(13\)
different outcomes contained within them.}

\footnotetext{Compound events with four different options.}

\end{example}

Working with these basic set operations should eventually become second
nature. There are often very many ways of expressing the same event
using these different operations, and finding the most useful method of
representing a particular event can often be the key to solving
challenging probability questions. The first step in making sure that
these tools are available to you is in ensuring that the basic
operations are fully understood, and this comes via practice. Remember,
unions represent ``ors'', intersections represent ``ands'', and
complements represent ``nots''.

\subsection{Using R To Represent Sample Spaces and Events and Performing
Set
Operations}\label{using-r-to-represent-sample-spaces-and-events-and-performing-set-operations}

We have seen how R can encode sets of elements using vectors. For
instance, we may take \texttt{sample\_space\ \textless{}-\ 1:6} to
represent the sample space of rolling a six-sided die. We can form
events by taking subsets of the relevant quantities, selecting via
indices. Fortunately, there are also all of the basic set operations
implemented in R. We can use \texttt{union(x,\ y)} to perform the union
of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}, \texttt{intersect(x,\ y)} to perform the
intersection of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}, and
\texttt{setdiff(x\ =\ sample\_space,\ y)} to perform the complement of
\texttt{y} (assuming that \texttt{sample\_space} contains the full
sample space).\footnote{R does not implement complements directly, and
  instead implements the set difference operation. The set difference
  function, \texttt{setdiff(x,\ y)} returns the set of all elements in
  \texttt{x} which are not in \texttt{y}, a sort of subtracting of sets.
  The complement of a set is defined to be
  \(A^C = \text{setdiff}(\mathcal{S}, A)\), indicating why this works!}

\section{Venn Diagrams}\label{venn-diagrams}

The sample space is partitioned into outcomes, and the outcomes can be
grouped together into events. These events are sets and can be
manipulated via basic set operations. Sometimes it is convenient to
represent this process graphically through the use of Venn diagrams. In
a Venn diagram, the sample space is represented by a rectangle with the
possible outcomes placed inside, and events are drawn inside of this as
circles containing the relevant outcomes.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-venn-diagram}A basic Venn diagram, representing the
sample space and two different events. In practice, the sample space
would have the possible outcomes written into the rectangle, and the
circled events would end up containing the relevant outcomes for those
events.}

\centering{

\includegraphics{graphics/ch2-venn-diagram-basic.png}

}

\end{figure}%

On the Venn diagram then, the overlap between circles represents their
intersection, the combined area of two (or more) circles represents
their union, and everything outside of a given circle represents the
complement of a set. This can be a fairly useful method for representing
sample spaces, and for visualizing the basic set operations that we use
to manipulate events inside the sample spaces. A word of caution: Venn
diagrams are useful tools, but they are not suitable as proofs
themselves. It is possible to convince yourself of false truths if the
wrong diagrams are used, and as a result, Venn diagrams should be
thought of as aids to understanding, rather than asa rigorous tool in
and of themselves.\footnote{This is a general principle in mathematics.
  Coming up with one example that makes something \emph{seem} true does
  not form an argument demonstrating that it \emph{is} true. Venn
  Diagrams should largely be thought of as specific examples of the
  underlying phenomena, which are great if you're a visual learner!}

\begin{figure}[H]

events A and B is shaded here in red. The union of two sets is all of

Draw a Venn diagram representing the original game that Charles and
Sadie played. On the diagram draw the events corresponding to ``At least
one head \textbf{and} one tail are observed'', and ``Sadie won the
game''. Recall that three coins are tossed, and Sadie wins if at least
two of them show heads.

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

The sample space contains the eight possible options. Only
\((\text{T}, \text{T}, \text{T})\) does not belong to at least one of
the events. Both events share \((\text{H},\text{H},\text{T})\),
\((\text{H},\text{T},\text{H})\), and \((\text{T},\text{H},\text{H})\).

Sample spaces, events, and the manipulation of these quantities forms a
critical component of understanding probability models. In particular,
they describe the complete set of occurrences in a statistical
experiment that we could be interested in assigning probability values
to. To formalize a probability model, however, we also need some rule
for assigning probability values.

\chapter{The Core Concepts of
Probability}\label{the-core-concepts-of-probability}

\section{Assigning Probabilities (and The Equally Likely Outcome
Model)}\label{assigning-probabilities-and-the-equally-likely-outcome-model}

There are a plethora of ways to assign probabilities to different
events. At the most basic level any rule that maps from the space of
possible events to real numbers between \(0\) and \(1\) can be used as
rules for probability assignment. That is, probability assignment is
simply a set of rules which says ``for this event assign this
probability.''

\begin{example}[Coin Toss
Probabilities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-coin-toss}{}\label{exm-coin-toss}

Suppose that the fair coin used by Charles and Sadie is tossed one time.
Write down the probability assignments relating to this experiment.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

In this case we have \(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H},\text{T}\}\). Thus, the
possible events for which we need to assign probabilities are
\(\emptyset\), \(\{\text{H}\}\), \(\{\text{T}\}\), and
\(\{\text{H},\text{T}\} = \mathcal{S}\). For any probability model we
have \(P(\emptyset) = 0\) and \(P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\). When we say that a
coin is ``fair'' we are saying that \(P(\text{T}) = P(\text{H})\), and
since these are the only two possible outcomes in the sample space, we
must have that they each have probability \(0.5\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Not every assignment of probability values is going to be valid.
Suppose, for instance, that we have a six-sided die, each side labelled
with a number from one to six. If I told you that there was a
probability of \(0.5\) that it comes up \(1\), \(0.5\) that it comes up
\(2\), \(0.5\) that it comes up \(3\), \(0.5\) that it comes up \(4\),
\(0.5\) that it comes up \(5\), and \(0.5\) that it comes up \(6\), you
would probably call me a liar.\footnote{Or else conclude that I was
  mistaken and maybe should not be teaching probability.} If, as we have
previously seen, probabilities represent the long run proportion of time
that a particular event is observed, we cannot have \(6\) different
outcomes each occurring in half of all cases.

Beyond the requirements that we impose on what constitutes a ``valid''
probability rule, we have another concern: scalability. It is perfectly
acceptable to indicate that in an experiment with \(3\) outcomes, the
first has a probability of \(0.25\), the second of \(0.3\), and the
third of \(0.45\). What if the experiment has \(100\) possible outcomes?
Or \(1000\)? It quickly becomes apparent that enumerating the
probabilities of each event in the sample space is an efficient way of
assigning probabilities in practice. A core focus of our study of
probability will be finding techniques that allow us to efficiently
encode probability information into manageable objects. Once we have
done this we will be in a position where we can manipulate these
(comparatively) simple mathematical quantities in order to make
statements and conclusions about any of the events of interest, even if
they have never been explicitly outlined as having an assigned
probability.

While we will consider myriad methods for accomplishing these goals
throughout our study of probability, we begin with a very useful model
which simplifies probability assignment, without any added complexity,
and creates a solid foundation for us to explore the properties of
probability models. We start by considering \textbf{equally likely
outcomes.} As the name suggests, the probability model considering
equally likely outcomes assigns an equal probability to every possible
outcome of the experiment. This is a probability model that we are
already distinctly familiar with: flipping a coin, rolling a die, or
drawing a card are all examples of experiments which rely on the equally
likely outcomes framework.

\begin{remark}[Statisticians and Urn Models]
In statistics and probability courses and books you will often have
instructors or authors using fairly simple models to illustrate
probability concepts. There will often be questions relating to coin
tosses, and dice, and decks of cards, and everyone's favourite: urns. It
will very frequently be the case that a statistics question will state
that there is an urn with some combination of coloured balls within it,
from which you will be selecting some number either with or without
replacement. The frequency of these types of examples and questions
often feels disconnected from the refrain that ``uncertainty is all
around us'' and that ``statistics is relevant to every aspect of our
world!''\footnote{One of the most famous quotes from a statistician was
  a thought shared by John Tukey, stating ``The best thing about being a
  statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.'' This is
  a common refrain, and one rooted in truth. Statistics is everywhere,
  across every field of human inquiry, and can help us make sense of
  everything from the trivial to the deeply important.} Why is it that
we seldom see questions or examples that are directly tied to these wide
spread applications of the lessons and techniques being taught?

In part these simple experiments are cleaner to handle than ``real
world'' situations. We can easily assume that a die is fair and that
takes care of any unsuspecting wrinkles that will necessarily come along
with the ``real world''. This is not dissimilar to working under the
assumption of frictionless surfaces in introductory physics, or assuming
that human beings are rational in economics. Another key point is that
most of us have deep familiarity with dice, and coins, and
cards.\footnote{This does not help to explain why we use urns so much,
  of course. When was the last time any of us drew a ball from an urn?}
The same is not going to be true of stories that are derived from
different use cases in the real world. A final important point, and this
will be something we see in depth in the coming chapters, is that from a
statistical point of view: there is no difference. Once we have the
tools to work with these quantities, we have the tools to work with any
of the quantities. This actually distinguishes the use of these types of
examples in statistics and probability from those for other subjects: at
no point is anything that we are learning incorrect, or overly simple -
we are just focusing on the raw probabilistic nature of the phenomenon.
As a result, we will continue to see these simple models in these notes.
I would encourage you, whenever possible, to hold a topic in mind that
matters more to you and start trying to draw the parallels between
rolling dice, and whatever it is that you may care about.

Why urns, specifically? Well, whether it be coin flipping or dice
rolling or card selection, we can model this equivalently using an urn
(with \(2\), \(6\), and \(52\) items, respectively). The urn becomes
more flexible to \emph{exactly} dictate what the probability of any
selection will be, which is a useful way of moving from equally likely
models (each ball is equally likely to be selected) to arbitrary models
(we can have however many identical balls in the urn as we would like).
\end{remark}

If we have an experiment with a sample space \(\mathcal{S}\) which has
\(|\mathcal{S}| = k\) total elements\footnote{Note that, when we have a
  set, using the absolute value symbols \(|\cdot|\) stands for the
  \textbf{cardinality} of the set. Cardinality is just a fancy way of
  saying the size or the number of elements that the set has in it.},
then each element of the sample space occurs with probability
\(\frac{1}{k}\). In the case of the coin toss example,
\(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\}\), and so \(k=2\) and each
outcome occurs with probability \(\frac{1}{2}\). In the case of drawing
a card at random, there are \(52\) different outcomes, and so \(k=52\),
and the probability of drawing any particular card is \(\frac{1}{52}\).

It is critically important to recognize that the equal probability model
assigns equal likelihood to the possible outcomes of an experiment, not
the possible events of interest. It will not be the case that all events
have the same probability. To make this concrete, consider the events
\(A\) ``the ace of spades is drawn'' and \(B\) ``any spade is drawn''.
It is clear that \(B\) happens more frequently than \(A\), even though
we have said that this is an experiment with equally likely outcomes.
Remember: an outcome is an observation from a single experimental run,
an event is any collection of these possible outcomes.

A core goal is then bridging the gap between the probability of an
outcome\footnote{A quantity which in the equally likely outcome
  framework, we know exactly.} and the probability of an event. In order
to do so, we will next consider the rules of probability, introducing
properties that are required for valid probability assignments, and the
techniques for manipulating probabilities to calculate the probabilities
of quantities of interest.

\subsection{Using R for the Equally Likely Probability
Model}\label{using-r-for-the-equally-likely-probability-model}

In the previous chapter we saw how we can codify sample spaces and
events using vectors in R. In the introduction we actually saw how can
sample from a sample space using the equally likely outcome framework.
Specifically, an application of the \texttt{sample} function will draw a
set number of values from a sample space, giving each value an equal
probability to be drawn.\footnote{The \texttt{sample} function can also
  be used without equally likely events by specifying a vector of
  probabilities, however, this is a less common use case.}

\section{The Axioms of Probability}\label{the-axioms-of-probability}

We have previously seen that not every probability assignment can be
valid. For instance, assigning \(0.5\) probability to each outcome on a
die leads to a nonsensical scenario. With just a little imagination, we
can conjure equally nonsensical scenarios in other ways. For instance,
it would make very little sense to discuss the probability of an event
being a negative value. What would it mean for an event to occur in a
negative proportion of experimental runs? Alternatively, we can consider
two events that are nested in one another: say event \(A\) is that we
draw the ace of spades, and event \(B\) is that we draw any spade. Every
single time that \(A\) happens, we know that \(B\) also happens. But
there are ways that \(B\) can occur where \(A\) does not.\footnote{For
  instance, the Queen of spades being drawn.} If I told you the
probability of \(A\) was \(0.5\) and the probability of \(B\) was
\(0.2\), this would violate our base instincts. How can it be more
likely to draw the ace of spades than it would be to draw any spade at
all?\footnote{This is actually a scenario where our instincts may lead
  us awry in some situations. Consider the following from Kahneman and
  Tversky (1972): {Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very
  bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply
  concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also
  participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable?
  (a) Linda is a bank teller, or (b) Linda is a bank teller and is
  active in the feminist movement.} A majority of respondents rate (b)
  as being more probable, even though (a) is contained in (b).}

Often in mathematics when we have an intuitive set of rules\footnote{These
  rules, which we call ``properties'' are formally known as ``axioms''.}
that particular quantities must obey, we work to add formality through
defining properties of these concepts. To this end, we can define the
key properties that probabilities must obey in order to be well-defined,
valid probabilities. With three fairly basic properties, we can
completely specify what must be true in order for a set of probabilities
to be ``valid'', and to in turn match with our intuitions.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Axioms of Probability}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Unitary:} Every valid set of probabilities must assign a
  probability of \(1\) to the full sample space. That is,
  \(P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\). This is an intuitive requirement as every time
  the experiment is run we observe an outcome in the sample space. As a
  result, in every experimental run the event \(\mathcal{S}\) occurs.
\item
  \textbf{Non-negative:} We require that every probability is
  non-negative. We can have probabilities of \(0\), but we can never
  have a probability less than zero. Again, this is
  sensible\footnotemark{} but is important to include in our
  formalization. Specifically, for every event \(E\), we must have
  \(P(E) \geq 0\).
\item
  \textbf{Additivity:} the final property requires slightly more parsing
  on first pass. Suppose that we define a sequence of events,
  \(E_1, E_2, E_3, \dots\) such that no two events have any overlap.
  That is, \(E_j \cap E_\ell = \emptyset\) for all \(\ell\neq j\). Then,
  the final property we require for probabilities is that
  \[P\left(\bigcup_i E_i\right) = \sum_i P(E_i).\] That is, the
  probability of the union of disjoint events is the summation of the
  probability of these events.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{What would it mean to have a negative probability? It is
perhaps a more interesting question than it seems at first glance. It is
a topic that has come up in some pretty strange places and, while it is
not presently sensible to call them ``probabilities'' in a traditional
sense, there are interesting results which follow.}

It is worth dwelling slightly on axiom 3. Consider the case of drawing a
card at random from a deck of \(52\) cards. Using the equally likely
outcome model for probability we know that the probability that any card
is drawn is given by \(\frac{1}{52}\). If I were to ask ``what is the
probability you draw that ace of spades?'' under this model you can
respond, immediately, with \(\frac{1}{52}\). Now, if I were to ask
``what is the probability that you draw the ace of spades or the two of
spades?'' then intuitively you likely figure that this will be
\(\frac{2}{52}\). Note that the event \(E_1\), ``draw the ace of
spades'' and the event \(E_2\) ``draw the two of spades'', are disjoint
events. Moreover, recall that the union is the ``or'' and so
\(E_1\cup E_2\) is the same as \(E_1\) or \(E_2\). Taken together then,
\[P(E_1\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2).\] The axiom of additivity simply
extends this intuition to an arbitrary number of events.

\begin{example}[Basic
Additivity]\protect\hypertarget{exm-additivity}{}\label{exm-additivity}

Still unsure of how best to go about using cards to replace their coin
game, Charles and Sadie are considering various different events and
trying to understand their probabilistic behaviour. They take \(S\),
\(C\), \(H\), and \(D\) to be the events that a spade, club, heart, or
diamond are drawn from a standard deck of cards, respectively. Further,
they take \(C_j\) to be the event that a card with denomination \(j\) is
drawn (\(j\) ranging from ace with \(1\) through King with \(13\)). If
they consider the union of any two (or more) of these events when can
they leverage properties of additivity? When can't they?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

In order to use the properties of additivity it is required that the two
events are disjoint. Note that taking any two (or more) of \(S\), \(C\),
\(H\), and \(D\) will lead to disjoint events. There is no way to draw a
card which has two suits on it at once. Similarly, taking any two (or
more) of \(C_j\) will lead to disjoint events. However, mixing any of
the suited events (\(S\), \(C\), \(H\), and \(D\)) with any \(C_j\) will
not be disjoint.

Consider \(S\cap C_1\). The ace of spades is in \(S\) since it is a
spade and it is in \(C_1\) since it is an ace. As a result,
\(S\cap C_1 = \{\text{Ace of Spades}\}\). Because of this we are not
able to say that \(P(A \cup C_1) = P(A) + P(C_1)\). However, we can say
that \[P(S\cup C\cup H\cup D) = P(S) + P(C) + P(H) + P(D),\] and could
do the same with any subset of these sets. Similarly, we can take
\[P\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{13} C_j\right) = \sum_{j=1}^{13} P(C_j),\] or
any of the subsets there.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

These three axioms fully define valid probabilities. Any mechanism that
assigns probability values to events which conforms to these rules will
assign valid probabilities. While it may seem counterintuitive that such
basic rules fully define our notion of a probability, these rules
readily give rise to many other properties that are indispensible when
working with probabilities.

\section{Secondary Properties of
Probabilities}\label{secondary-properties-of-probabilities}

Using the previously indicated axioms of probability we are able to
derive many useful \textbf{secondary properties}. These properties will
frequently be used to actually compute different probabilities, and are
helpful to become familiar with. All of the following properties follow
directly from the axioms, though, some are more clear than others. For
the following we take \(E\) and \(E_1,E_2,E_3,\dots\) to be arbitrary
events on some well defined sample space.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(E^C) = 1-P(E)\), and equivalently, \(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\).
\item
  \(P(\emptyset) = 0\).
\item
  \(P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1\cap E_2)\).
\item
  \begin{multline*}P(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) + P(E_3) - P(E_1\cap E_2) - P(E_1 \cap E_3) \\ - P(E_2 \cap E_3) + P(E_1 \cap E_2 \cap E_3).\end{multline*}
\item
  If \(E_1 \subset E_2\) then \(P(E_1) \leq P(E_2)\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Proofs of the Secondary Properties of Probability}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

It may be instructive to see how these properties are derived. Doing so
generates added familiarity with manipulating probability expressions
and helps to encourage deeper understanding.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Note that, for any event \(E\), by definition we have
  \(E \cup E^C = \mathcal{S}\) and \(E \cap E^C = \emptyset\). As a
  result, we can apply \textbf{additivity} to the sets \(E\) and \(E^C\)
  giving \(P(E \cup E^C) = P(E) + P(E^C)\). However, since
  \(E\cup E^C = \mathcal{S}\), then we know that
  \(P(E \cup E^C) = P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\) by the \textbf{unitary}
  property. Taken together this tells us that \(1 = P(E) + P(E^C)\), and
  rearranging gives \(P(E^C) = 1 - P(E)\), or \(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\), as
  required.
\item
  We know that \(\mathcal{S}^C = \emptyset\). Using secondary property
  (1), \(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\). Taking \(E = \emptyset\) gives
  \(P(\emptyset) = 1 - P(\mathcal{S}) = 1 - 1 = 0\), by the
  \textbf{unitary} property.
\item
  Here note that \(E_1 \cup E_2\) can be written as \(E_1 \cup E_2'\)
  where \(E_2' = E_2\cap E_1^C\). That is, \(E_2'\) contains the
  outcomes from \(E_2\) which were not shared by \(E_1\). Then
  \(E_1 \cap E_2' = \emptyset\) so we can write
  \(P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1 \cup E_2') = P(E_1) + P(E_2')\), by
  \textbf{additivity}. Now, if we define \(E_2^* = E_2\cap E_1\) then
  \(E_2 = E_2' \cup E_2^*\), and \(E_2'\cap E_2^* = \emptyset\). Thus,
  \(P(E_2) = P(E_2'\cup E_2^*) = P(E_2') + P(E_2^*)\). Rearranging this
  gives \(P(E_2') = P(E_2) - P(E_2^*)\), and we know that
  \(P(E_2^*) = P(E_1 \cap E_2)\). Thus, plugging into what we found
  before we get
  \[P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2') = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1 \cap E_2).\]
\item
  This follows exactly from the argument for (3). To see, first consider
  \(E_2 \cup E_3\) to be an event itself, say \(E_4\). Then we can apply
  the above result to \(E_1 \cup E_4\). And then we need only repeat the
  process for the remaining terms.
\item
  We can rewrite \(E_2\) as \(E_1 \cup (E_2 \cap E_1^C)\). These two
  sets are disjoint, since the one is \(E_1\) and the other must contain
  only elements in \(E_1^C\). Then,
  \(P(E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2 \cap E_1^C)\) by \textbf{additivity}. Then,
  through the \textbf{non-negative} property we know that
  \(P(E_2 \cap E_1^C) \geq 0\), and so rearranging we have
  \(P(E_1) = P(E_2) - P(E_2\cap E_1^C) \leq P(E_2)\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

These properties are immensely useful when computing probabilities. In
fact, these secondary properties will be used with more frequency than
the basic axioms when manipulating probabilities in practice. It is
worth building comfort with these properties, early and often, as they
will assist in manipulating all probability expressions in the future.

While these properties hold in general for all probability models, it is
instructive to focus on the equal probability model to begin building
familiarity with probability. These properties allow us to take events
-- whether compound or simple -- and combine, rewrite, and manipulate
expressions to assist in the handling of the computations. Eventually,
however, we require the ability to assign numerical values to these
probabilities.

Consider a simple event, \(A\). Recall that a simple event is defined as
a possible outcome of an experiment, and so in this case, \(A\)
corresponds directly to an event that may be observed. If our sample
space is \(k\) elements large, then \(P(A) = \frac{1}{k}\) in this
framework. For instance, if \(A\) is the event that a two is rolled on a
six-sided fair die, then \(P(A) = \frac{1}{6}\).

Now, suppose that a compound event is defined, \(B\). By definition, a
compound event can be expressed as a set of possible outcomes from the
experiment. Suppose that we enumerate these possible events as
\(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_\ell\). Then we know that \(B\) occurs if any of
\(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_\ell\) occur. Each \(b_j\) are elements of the sample
space and correspond to possible outcomes of the experiment. As a
result, we know that \(P(b_j) = \frac{1}{k}\), based on the equal
probability assumption. Now, if we take any two distinct events, say
\(b_i\) and \(b_j\), we know that they must be disjoint:
\(b_i \cap b_j = \emptyset\). This is because in an experiment run only
one outcome can occur. Moreover, we can say that
\(B = b_1 \cup b_2 \cup\cdots\cup b_\ell\).

Using the axioms of probability outlined above we therefore know that
\(P(B) = \sum_{j=1}^\ell P(b_j) = \sum_{j=1}^\ell \frac{1}{k} = \frac{\ell}{k}\).
This holds in general for any compound event in this setting. If we take
\(B\) to be the event that an even number is rolled on a six-sided die,
then we would have \(b_1\) is the event that a two is rolled, \(b_2\) is
the event that a four is rolled, and \(b_3\) is the event that a six is
rolled. There are three such events, and so the probability that an even
number is rolled must be \(\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\), which matches our
intuition.

If we consider what this process is doing at its core, we can reframe
the calculation as counting up the number of ways that event can happen
and dividing by the total number of events. In our previous discussion,
there were \(\ell\) ways of \(B\) occurring, a total of \(k\) outcomes,
and so the probability becomes \(\frac{\ell}{k}\). In the equal
probability model, this will always be the case. The probability of any
event \(A\) occurring is given by \[P(A) = \frac{N_A}{k},\] where
\(N_A\) is the number of unique ways that \(A\) can occur. In other
words, \(N_A\) is the size of the set \(A\), \(|A|\).

As a result of this, computing probabilities largely relies on the
counting of possible outcomes corresponding to different events. If we
can determine \(N_A = |A|\), and the count of the total number of
occurrences, \(k\), then we can determine the probability of \(A\). This
study of counting is known as \textbf{combinatorics}, and it is where we
will turn our attention next.

\begin{example}[Unmatched Six-Sided
Dice]\protect\hypertarget{exm-complement-trick}{}\label{exm-complement-trick}

Charles and Sadie, not all together content with the progress through
decks of cards, are considering games with dice. Suppose that they have
two, fair, six-sided dice. They are interested in the probability that
the two dice show different numbers when they are rolled. What is this
probability?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Here, the key is to realize that the probability is easier to solve when
considering the complement rather than the event itself. Notably,
rolling two, fair, six-sided dice gives a total of \(36\) possible
outcomes. Of these, exactly \(6\) have equal numbers showing on both
dice. Thus, the probability that the two dice show the \textbf{same}
number is going to be \(\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}\). Then, using the
fact that \(P(E) = 1 - P(E^C)\), and that taking \(E\) to refer to the
event where the two dice show different numbers, then \(E^C\) refers to
the event that the two dice show the \emph{same} number. As a result,
the probability that we want is
\(P(E) = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[Unmatched Arbitrary
Dice]\protect\hypertarget{exm-complement-trick-two}{}\label{exm-complement-trick-two}

Charles and Sadie, working from their intrigue about dice, have decided
that instead of using two six-sided dice, they wish to take two dice of
possibly different sizes. Suppose that the first die has \(d_1\) sides
and the second has \(d_2\) sides, and that both dice are otherwise fair.
They are interested in the probability that the two dice show different
numbers when they are rolled. What is this probability?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

This problem is conceptually no different from
Example~\ref{exm-complement-trick}. There will be a total of
\(d_1\times d_2\) possible combinations of the two dice to be
rolled.\footnotemark{} Of these, the dice will match in
\(\min\{d_1, d_2\}\) events.\footnotemark{} Then, with the same
complement trick discussed above, we get
\[P(E) = 1 - P(E^C) = 1 - \frac{\min\{d_1,d_2\}}{d_1\times d_2}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Note: if this is not yet clear to you, that's okay! In the
very next section we begin to discuss how to count the possible
combinations in these types of scenarios.}

\footnotetext{Suppose that \(d_1 = 2\) and \(d_2 = 4\). Then here, the
dice can match when they show either \(1\) or \(2\), but if the second
die shows \(3\) or \(4\) there is no possibility of having a match at
all.}

\end{example}

\section{Combinatorics}\label{combinatorics}

\subsection{The Product Rule}\label{the-product-rule}

Fundamentally, counting is a matter of assessing the size of a
collection of items. Sometimes, this is very straightforward. If you
want to count the number of students in a classroom, you start at \(1\)
and enumerate upwards through the integers. To count the number of days
until the next Holiday, you do the same thing. If you really need to
sleep, perhaps you will count imaginary sleep until you drift off. There
is not much to this type of counting, and it is certainly deeply
familiar to you all. However, it is also quite limited in its utility.

Imagine that you are interested in determining how many possible ways
there are of arranging a deck of \(52\) cards. You could of course
arrange them in a particular order, then count each of those. That would
take a tremendous amount of time, so perhaps instead of using an actual
deck you just write down the combinations. Still, each combination is
going to be \(52\) cards long, and keeping track of that all will be a
tremendous challenge. This seems like an approachable question, and yet,
it illustrates how complicated (and large) these types of ``counting''
problems can become very quickly.

Fortunately for us there are some strategies for simplifying these
problems down, some of which you are likely already familiar with. Think
about trying to form an outfit where you have \(4\) different sweaters,
\(3\) pairs of pants, and \(2\) options for your shoes. Suppose that any
combination of these will work well. How many total outfits are there?
Well, if you have already picked your sweater and pants, then there are
going to be \(2\) different outfits using these: one with each of the
pairs of shoes. This is true for each possible sweater-pant combination,
and so we can count \(2\) for each one these. In other words, to get the
total number of outfits we multiply the number of sweater-pant
combinations by the number of shoe options. The same rationale can be
applied to count the total number of sweater-pant combinations. For each
sweater, there are \(3\) pairs of possible pants, and so to get the
total number we can take \(3\) for each possible sweater, or in other
words, \(3\times 4\). Taken together then we have
\(4\times 3\times 2 = 24\) total possible outfits.

Another way of framing this is that we have to make three sequential
decisions: which of the \(4\) sweaters, which of the \(3\) pants, and
which of the \(2\) shoes are to be worn? When we do this we multiply
through the number of alternatives at each decision point to get the
total number of combinations. This is known as the \textbf{product rule
for counting}.

\begin{definition}[Product Rule for
Counting]\protect\hypertarget{def-product-rule-count}{}\label{def-product-rule-count}

The product rule for counting states that, when there are a sequence of
\(k\) decisions to be made, and for each decision \(j=1,\dots,k\), there
are \(n_j\) options, then the total number of combinations will be
\[N = n_1\times n_2\times\cdots\times n_k.\]

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Counting Coffee
Orders]\protect\hypertarget{exm-counting-coffee-orders}{}\label{exm-counting-coffee-orders}

When Charles and Sadie are out for coffee, Sadie enjoys ordering the
same thing each time: a black coffee and vegan chocolate chip cookie.
Charles, on the other hand, has decided to work through the entire menu
of the local coffee shop, each day ordering a drink, with one add-in,
and a snack. If there are \(10\) different drinks, \(8\) possible
add-ins, and \(12\) different snacks, how many trips to the coffee shop
will it take until Charles has tried it all?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

This necessitates an application of the product rule for counting.
Specifically, we can view this as three sequential decisions, where the
first decision is which drink (with \(n_1 = 10\)), the second decision
is which add-in (with \(n_2 = 8\)), and the third decision is which
snack (with \(n_3 = 12\)). Taking the product gives the total number of
combinations as \(10\times 8\times 12 = 960\). As a result, it will take
\(960\) visits (assuming that nothing on the menu changes!) to try all
combinations.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[Sequence of Dice
Rolls]\protect\hypertarget{exm-rolling-sequence-of-dice}{}\label{exm-rolling-sequence-of-dice}

Charles and Sadie have been enjoying playing with dice, but they lost
one of the two they had. As a result, they are trying to come up with
games revolving around rolling a single die. They decide to try a game
called ``six is lava'', where they roll a single six-sided die \(10\)
times in a row. If they get \(1\) or more sixes, they lose the game.
They are not sure if \(10\) is the correct number of rolls to use. What
is the probability that they lose on any given set of \(10\) rolls of
the die in this game?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Once again this is a scenario where using the complement simplifies the
problem. If we asked ``what is the probability that no 6's are rolled,
on \(10\) rolls of the die'' then we can count the number of
possibilities through an application of the product rule. In particular,
there are going to be \(5\) options which are not \(6\) at each possible
step. We can view this as have \(n_1 = n_2 = \cdots = n_{10} = 5\).
Thus, the total number of ways of rolling \textbf{no} sixes is
\(5\times5\times5\times\cdots\times5 = 5^{10}\).

Essentially the same process can be used to count the total number of
possible rolls, replacing \(5\) with \(6\) to get the denominator. This
means that there are \(6^{10}\) total sequences of \(10\) rolls, and
\(5^{10}\) which contain no sixes. As a result, taking \(E\) to
represent the probability that we observe no sixes on \(10\) rolls of
the die, we would get \[P(E) = \frac{5^{10}}{6^{10}}.\] The question
asks for \(E^C\) and so we take
\[P(E^C) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{10}.\] This is
approximately 0.8385.

Note that if instead of \(10\) flips they had \(n\) flips, the
probability would be \(1 - \left(5/6\right)^n\). We can plot this over
various values of \(n\), to see how the number of flips impacts this
probability. The probability of \(0.5\) is marked and we can see that
taking \(4\) tosses gives an ever so slightly greater than \(0.5\)
probability of losing (0.5177).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Tree Diagrams}\label{tree-diagrams}

Sometimes it is helpful to express counting rules graphically. To do so
we rely on tree diagrams.

\begin{definition}[Tree
Diagram]\protect\hypertarget{def-tree-diagram}{}\label{def-tree-diagram}

A tree diagram is a graphical representation for the product rule of
counting. Specifically, a tree diagram puts each of the decisions in
sequence, and draws a branch for each separate option, starting from the
branches drawn at the previous decision step.

\end{definition}

To draw a tree diagram, you start with the first choice, drawing one
branch for each of the \(n_1\) alternatives, labelling each. Then, at
the second choice, you do the same process at the end of each of the
branches you drew for choice \(1\), this time drawing \(n_2\) branches
there (so you will have just drawn \(n_1\times n_2\) branches). Then for
each of those you draw the \(n_3\) further branches, and so on and so
forth until the end.

If you want to know the total number of choices, you simply count the
end points at the very end of the diagram. Each branch corresponds to a
single option. To determine which combination of choices it corresponds
to, you simply read off the branch labels at each branch you take. If
you want to know how many possible combinations come with certain
options selected, you can look at only those branches which are
downstream from the choices that you care about.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-tree-diagram-general}A generic tree diagram. Here
the first choice has three different options and the second choice has
two. We can see the six total combinations, labelled on the right of the
diagram, and can trace the choices required to get there.}

\centering{

\includegraphics{graphics/ch3-tree-diagram-generic.png}

}

\end{figure}%

While tree diagrams can be quite useful for visualizing a problem, they
often grow to be overly complex. As a result, we need to fall back on
the numerical representation afforded to us through the product rule for
counting. Counting problems, in general, can very quickly become
tremendously large and complex. For this reason, we have several tools
to assist us in reducing this complexity based on common types of
problems that we would like to count.

\subsection{The Factorial}\label{the-factorial}

The first useful tool for simplifying these problems is the
\textbf{factorial}. The factorial of an integer, denoted by \(x!\) is
given by the product of all integers from \(x\) to \(1\).\footnote{Factorials
  are exciting because they always look like they are shouting!} That
is, \[x! = x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(2)(1).\] If we consider the product rule
for counting then note that if \(n_1=1\), \(n_2=2\), \ldots{} ,
\(n_k = k\), then the total number of options is
\(k\times(k-1)\times\cdots\times 1 = k!\). The most common reason that
this comes up is when we want to order a collection of items. Suppose
that you have \(10\) books that you want to place on a shelf. You can
view this as making \(10\) sequential decisions: what book goes first,
second, third, and so on. There are \(10\) options for the first book,
then \(9\) for the second (any except for the first one), and then \(8\)
for the third (any except for the first \(2\)). This continues down to
the last book, and so we conclude that there are
\(10\times9\times8\times\cdots\times1 = 10!\) ways of arranging these
books.

\begin{example}[Seating in a (Full) Coffee
Shop]\protect\hypertarget{exm-factorial}{}\label{exm-factorial}

One day Charles and Sadie walk into the coffee shop and find that it is
completely full. There are ten seats and ten people sitting in them.
They are disappointed that they do not have room to sit themselves,
however, they are never ones to pass up an interesting probability
question.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How many different ways could these ten people have sat in these ten
  seats?
\item
  If there are ten drinks that have been made, and one is to be passed
  out to each seat, how many different ways can these ten people sit in
  these ten seats, with each of these ten drinks?
\item
  Alongside the ten drinks, there are ten snacks to be served up as
  well. How many different ways can these ten people sit in these ten
  seats, with each of these ten drinks, and each of these ten snacks?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Here, we can think about lining up the ten seats in a row, each number
  \(1\) through \(10\). Then, we want to place one patron into each of
  the seats. This is no different from ordering \(10\) books, and so the
  total is \(10!\) which is \(3,628,800\).
\item
  Note that we still have to make the seat choices from part (a), so
  there are \(10!\) ways of getting the \(10\) people sat in the \(10\)
  chairs. Once there, we can think of handing out the drinks to each of
  the numbered combinations of person-chair. This is no different from
  passing out the people as well, giving \(10!\) ways of doing this. We
  use the product rule to combine these two choices, with
  \(10!\times 10!\) total combinations of people-chair-drink. This is
  \(13,168,189,440,000\).
\item
  Extending the same logic before, there are \(10!\times 10!\) ways of
  getting each person sat in a chair with a drink. Then, there will be
  an additional \(10!\) ways of passing out the snacks to these people.
  Taken together this gives \(10!\times 10!\times 10!\) which is
  \(47,784,725,839,872,000,000\).\footnotemark{}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{It is somewhat interesting to note how large these values
get relatively quickly. This is a comparatively small question: only
\(10\) people with \(10\) drinks and \(10\) snacks. If you consider any
counting problem with a larger number of items, these problems quickly
grow to be intensely complex. For instance, a count of my main home book
collection reveals \(376\) of them. To order these would give \(376!\)
possible orderings. In decimal representation this is
\[4.992244775852435618292576458782762114148884082811840265632\dots\times10^{806}.\]
This is an \(807\) digit long number. This is an incomprehensibly large
number. This number is \(8×10^{726}\) \textbf{times larger than} the
number of atoms in the universe. That is, if every atom in the universe
were given some arrangements of books to hold onto, they would need to
hold \(8×10^{726}\) of them in order for all of the arrangements to be
held. I point this out because combinatorics \emph{explodes} in this
way. Even simple problems grow out of hand very, very quickly. This is
where comfort with the algebraic tools is required, rather than a
reliance on intuition. There is simply no way to have intuition
regarding the scope of these numbers, at least, not without a lot of
practice.}

\end{example}

\begin{remark}[0!]
Depending on how factorials are thought of, some trouble can come up
around a quantity like \(0!\). On one hand, if we view factorials as
multiplying each number between \(n\) and \(1\) together then
\(0! = 0\times 1\) and we get \(0! = 0\). On the other hand, if we view
factorials as counting the number of ways which we can order a set of
\(n\) items, then \(0!\) is the number of ways we can order \(0\) items,
which is \(1\).\footnote{Imagine I am placing books on my shelf. With
  \(3\) books there are \(3! = 6\) ways my shelf can look at the end.
  With \(2\) books there are \(2! = 2\) ways my shelf can look at the
  end. With \(1\) book there are \(1! = 1\) ways my shelf can look at
  the end. With \(0\) books there are \(0! = 1\) ways my shelf can look
  at the end.} So, which is it?

We take \(0!\) to be equal to \(1\). The ordering argument is perhaps
the most convincing. However, if you are algebraically minded you may
wonder how we get around the tricky issue of using our algebraic
definition. The key insight is to not define \(n!\) as the product of
the numbers from \(n\) to \(1\), but rather, to define
\[(n-1)! = \frac{n!}{n},\] and specify that \(1! = 1\). Then in this
case we get all of the usual requirements for how we have discussed
factorials, but we also get that \(0! = \frac{(0+1)!}{(0+1)} = 1\). As a
result, we will take \(0! = 1\).\footnote{Note, this does not help us
  with the factorials of negative numbers, nor of fractional numbers.
  Factorials \emph{can} be extended to these in sensible ways, but these
  are not for combinatorial purposes and are no longer ``factorials''
  exactly.}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Permutations and
Combinations}\label{permutations-and-combinations}

Sometimes, we want to order items from a collection, but we want to only
take a subset of these times. That is, suppose that you have \(20\)
books, only \(9\) of them will fit on the self, and you want to know
``how many ways can you put \(10\) books on the shelf, in order, from
your collection of \(20\)?'' Using the product rule of counting for this
directly, we recognize that there are \(20\) options for the first, then
\(19\), then \(18\), and so on until there are \(12\) choices for the
\(10\)th book to place. We can write this out in a seemingly strange
way. \begin{align*}
  &\ \frac{(20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12)(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}{(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)} \\
  &= \frac{(20)(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12)\cancel{(11)}\cancel{(10)}\cancel{(9)}\cancel{(8)}\cancel{(7)}\cancel{(6)}\cancel{(5)}\cancel{(4)}\cancel{(3)}\cancel{(2)}\cancel{(1)}}{\cancel{(11)}\cancel{(10)}\cancel{(9)}\cancel{(8)}\cancel{(7)}\cancel{(6)}\cancel{(5)}\cancel{(4)}\cancel{(3)}\cancel{(2)}\cancel{(1)}}
\end{align*}

This expression is \(20!\) divided by \(11!\), and gives the same as our
argument from the product rule for counting directly. This is a more
general result than our example with books would suggest. If we have
\(n\) items, and we want to choose \(k\) of them taking into account the
order those choices, it will always be \(n!\) divided by \((n-k)!\). We
call this a permutation.

\begin{definition}[Permutations]\protect\hypertarget{def-permutation}{}\label{def-permutation}

If we wish to select \(k\) items from a collection of \(n\) items, where
the ordering of these selections matters, then the total number is
referred to as a permutation. Mathematically,
\[P_{n,k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\]

\end{definition}

Permutations arise when we select ordered subsets from a collection. We
often, in combinatorial problems, talk about ordering, though sometimes
what we mean by this is slightly more abstract. Suppose that you want to
form a committee with \(5\) different people, each of which occupies a
different role: the president, vice president, treasurer, note taker,
and critic. If there are \(30\) people to select for this then there are
\(P_{30,5}\) total possible committees that can be formed. While there
is not a sequential order here, we talk about this as being ``ordered''
since we can differentiate between the five roles. Instead of labelling
them with their names, we could label them \(1\) through \(5\) and make
the ordering more explicit.

\begin{example}[Seating in a (Not Full) Coffee
Shop]\protect\hypertarget{exm-permutations}{}\label{exm-permutations}

Still haunted by that time when the coffee shop was full, Sadie and
Charles enter the coffee shop at a later date and find that, including
themselves, there are only \(7\) patrons in the store, and still the
\(10\) seats to choose from.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How many different ways can the \(7\) people sit in the \(10\)
  different chairs?
\item
  If there are \(10\) drinks on the menu, how many different ways can
  each person choose a chair and a drink?
\item
  If the coffee shop can make only one of each drink, how does the
  previous total change?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  In this case we are looking to order subsets from a total collection.
  If we line up the \(7\) patrons we then need to select \(7\) chairs to
  go with them, and keep these ordered. This is simply
  \[P_{10,7} = \frac{10!}{3!} = 604800.\]
\item
  In this part of the question we know that the \(7\) people have
  \(P_{10,7}\) ways of sitting into seats, we can view this as decision
  one. Then, for each of these \(7\) people there is a decision of what
  drink they will order. For these \(7\) decisions,
  \(n_2 = \cdots = n_8 = 10\). As a result, we get the total number is
  \[P_{10,7}\times10\times10\times\cdots\times10 = P_{10,7}\times 10^{7} = 6,048,000,000,000.\]
\item
  This setting, like part (b) starts with a first decision involving
  \(P_{10,7}\) choices. Then, instead of there being \(7\) more
  decisions with \(10\) choices each, we can either view this as \(7\)
  more choices with a descending number of options \(10\) for the first,
  then \(9\), and so on, or we can view this as a single choice where we
  need to select \(7\) \textbf{ordered} options from the \(10\) drinks
  available. This gives \[P_{10,7} \times P_{10,7} = 365,783,040,000,\]
  total choices.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Factorials compute the number of orderings for a set of objects, and
permutations compute the number of ordered subsets from a collection of
objects. What about when we do not wish to differentiate the order of
subsets? Suppose that you still need to form a \(5\) person committee,
but you do not have explicit roles for the different members of the
committee. Here we cannot use a permutation directly, as we know that
this takes into account the order.

To determine the number of unordered subsets, we will consider a
different approach for taking ordered subsets. Suppose that we formulate
the ordered committee as a two step procedure. First, we select \(5\)
people without concern for their order. Then we choose which order they
will have. If \(M\) represents the number of unordered sets of \(5\)
from this population, the product rule for counting tells us that the
total number of ordered committees will be \(M\times 5!\), since there
are \(5!\) arrangements of the \(5\) people. Thus, we can write this
down as
\[P_{30,5} = \frac{30!}{25!} = M\times 5! \implies M = \frac{30!}{25!5!}.\]

This will be true far more broadly than our committee example. If we
want to select \(k\) items from a collection of \(n\), we will have
\(n!\) divided by the product of \(k!\) and \((n-k)!\). We refer to
these as combinations.

\begin{definition}[Combinations]\protect\hypertarget{def-combinations}{}\label{def-combinations}

If we wish to select \(k\) items from a collection of \(n\) items, where
the ordering of these selections does not matter, then the total number
is referred to as a combination. Mathematically,
\[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\]

\end{definition}

We read \(\binom{n}{k}\) as ``\(n\) choose \(k\)'', which translates to
``select \(k\) items from a population of \(n\) total options, without
concern for their order.''

To summarize: factorials allow us to order a complete collection,
permutations allow us to select a subset with consideration of the
ordering, and combinations allow us to select a subset from the
collection without regard to the order. These three techniques can be
used in combination with the product rule for counting to allow us to
have very complex total summations.

\begin{example}[Changing the Seating in the Coffee
Shop]\protect\hypertarget{exm-combinations}{}\label{exm-combinations}

Some nights, the coffee shop hosts local music acts. Because of the
added equipment, the coffee shop owners only keep out the number of
seats that are going to be required based on the number of tickets that
were sold.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If there are \(8\) tickets sold, how many different combinations of
  the \(10\) chairs can get left out?
\item
  Suppose that only \(6\) people end up showing up. How many different
  ways can the \(6\) people sit in the \(8\) chairs that are being
  selected from the \(10\) total possibilities?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Here, there is no ordering for the \(8\) chairs that are to be
  selected. As a result, we are simply looking for how many chairs can
  be selected from a group of \(10\) of them. This is
  \[\binom{10}{8} = \frac{10!}{8!\cdot 2!} = 45.\]
\item
  With the first choice having \(45\) possible options, the second
  choice that needs to be made is how \(6\) people sit into \(8\)
  chairs. Here the ordering \emph{does} matter, since the chairs are
  distinguishable. As a result, this is a permutations question, with
  there being a total of \(P_{8,6} = \frac{8!}{2!}\) ways of having the
  people select their seats. In total then there are
  \[\binom{10}{8}\times P_{8,6} = \frac{10!}{8!\cdot 2!}\cdot\frac{8!}{2!} = 907,200.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Less Common Counting
Techniques}\label{less-common-counting-techniques}

While most of the problems we address will revolve around permutations
and combinations (with heavy use of the product rule), there are
additional techniques which are important to know (and recognize when to
use). In particular, combinations and permutations each assume that we
are sampling from our set \textbf{without replacement}. That is, each
time you select an item, it is removed from the population. These are
the most common situations in these combinatorial problems, however,
there are \emph{some} situations which arise where we need to count the
number of ordered or unordered subsets \emph{with} replacement.

\subsubsection{Ordered Subsets with
Replacement}\label{ordered-subsets-with-replacement}

Consider, for instance, forming a password using only lowercase numbers
and letters. If you decide on a fixed length for the password, then
there are going to be \(36\) choices at each decision point, and you
want to take an ordered subset of these. This is forming an
\textbf{ordered subset with replacement}, and to count how many
different ways there are of doing this, we can simply use the product
rule. That is, you have \(36\) choices at each decision point, and so
there are \(36\times 36\times\cdots\times 36 = 36^k\) total decisions,
where \(k\) is the number of items to select.

In general, if you have \(n\) total items and you want to make an
ordered set of \(k\) of these items \textbf{with replacement} you will
have \(n^k\) total ways of doing this.

\subsubsection{Unordered Subsets with
Replacement}\label{unordered-subsets-with-replacement}

Forming unordered sets with replacement is slightly less intuitive.
Consider rolling \(k\) dice which are not distinguishable from one
another. We know that there are \(6\) total sides that can show up on
each of these dice, but how many different combinations of numbers can
show up overall? If the dice can be distinguished we would say that
there are \(6^k\) possible ways of doing this. However, some of these
combinations are going to be equivalent in the unordered world. Take the
simple case of \(k=2\). Here we have the following possibilities:
\begin{align*}
(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)&\\ 
(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)&\\ 
(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)&\\ 
(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)&\\ 
(5, 5), (5, 6)&\\ 
(6,6)&
\end{align*}

This gives a total of \(21\) possible combinations, rather than \(36\).

In general, if we want to find the way of selecting \(k\) elements
\emph{with replacement} from a total of \(n\), then the number of ways
of doing this will be \[\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\] In our example this gives
\(\binom{6+2-1}{2} = 21\).

\subsubsection{Permutations with Identical
Objects}\label{permutations-with-identical-objects}

Finally, it is worth understanding how to handle identical objects in
combinatorial problems. Suppose that, of the \(10\) books that we wish
to place on a shelf, we have \(2\) copies of one of them, \(3\) copies
of another one, and the other \(5\) have one copy each. Supposing that
there is no way to tell these identical objects apart, how many ways can
we arrange the bookshelf?

First, if we pretend that all of the items are actually able to be
differentiated then there are \(10!\) ways of placing these books. Now,
in any of these permutations, had we swapped the order of the first book
(with \(2\) copies) the ordering would have been indistinguishable. As a
result, for every ordering of the \(8\) other books, we counted that
permutation twice (when it should have only been counted once!). So to
address the two repeated copies we need to take \(10!/2\). Now, a
similar argument is going to hold for the book with \(3\) repeated
copies. However, instead of there being \(2\) permutations which are
identical, there are going to be \(3! = 6\) permutations which are
identical. This is because we can reorder the \(3\) copies of the book
in anyway we choose, and still wind up with the same overall
permutation.\footnote{In fact, the reason that there are \(2\) ways of
  doing this with the book with \(2\) copies is since \(2! = 2\).} As a
result, the total number is going to be
\[\frac{10!}{2!\cdot3!} = 302400.\]

We can see this same result through an alternative construction. First,
we select which of the \(10\) slots should have the first book. We do
not care about the order, and so there are \(\binom{10}{2}\) ways of
doing this. Next, we can select which of the \(8\) remaining slots
should have the second book. Like the first one there will be
\(\binom{8}{3}\) ways of placing these. Now, there are \(5\) slots
remaining, and \(5\) books to place, so as a result, we can order those
in \(5!\) different ways, and then slot them into the remaining places
in order. This gives, in total
\[\binom{10}{2}\binom{8}{3}(5!) = \frac{10!}{2!\cancel{8!}}\cdot\frac{\cancel{8!}}{3!\cancel{5!}}\cdot\cancel{5!} = \frac{10!}{2!3!}.\]

To generalize this, if we want to order \(n\) elements, such that there
are \(k\) distinguishable elements with \(n_1\) of the first type,
\(n_2\) of the second, and so forth until \(n_k\) of the last type
(\(n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k\)), then the total number of orderings
will be \[\frac{n!}{n_1!\cdot n_2!\cdots n_k!}.\]

\section{From Combinatorics to
Probability}\label{from-combinatorics-to-probability}

While combinatorics is a field of study on its own, with many intriguing
tools and developments surrounding the enumeration of objects, for the
purposes of simple probability models these tools will suffice.
Ultimately, we care about counting since in the equal probability model,
the probability of any event can be determined by counting the number of
ways that the event can occur and dividing by the total number of
outcomes that are possible. That is, we use these tools to derive
\(N_A\), the total number of ways that \(A\) can occur, and \(N\), the
total number of experimental outcomes, and then we conclude that
\[P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N}.\]

\begin{example}[Poker Hand
Counts]\protect\hypertarget{exm-poker-hands}{}\label{exm-poker-hands}

During one of their conversations, Charles and Sadie were remarking how
they never really played poker. As they understand it, in poker you are
dealt a hand of \(5\) cards and you want to use these \(5\) cards to try
to match certain sets of cards, some of which are more rare than others.
Charles and Sadie start to get hung-up on discussions regarding
``straights'' and ``flushes''.

A straight is any sequence of \(5\) cards in ascending order (where aces
can be low, or high). For instance, \(7, 8, 9, 10, \text{J}\) of any
suit. A flush, is any set of \(5\) cards belonging to the same suit.
Charles just \emph{feels} that straights have to be more rare than
flushes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How many different straights are there from a standard deck of cards?
\item
  How many different flushes are there from a standard deck of cards?
\item
  If dealt \(5\) cards at random, what is the probability of a flush?
  What is the probability of a straight?
\item
  A straight flush occurs when you have \(5\) cards in order, of the
  same suit. What is the probability of a straight flush?
\item
  If straight flushes were not counted as flushes, and not counted as
  straights, how do the probabilities of either hand change?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  A straight necessitates drawing five cards in order, with each of any
  suit. Just as with the straight flush, there are \(10\) possible
  starting values for the straight. Once we have selected the starting
  value, then for each of the five cards we can pick any of the four
  suits, resulting in \(4\) choices each. That gives
  \[N_A = 10\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4 = 10\times 4^5 = 10240.\]
\item
  A flush necessitates drawing \textbf{any} five cards from the same
  suit. If we had a suit fixed, there would be \({13\choose 5}\) ways of
  doing this, since we do not care about ordering. If we think about
  first choosing the suit, we have \(4\) ways of doing that, resulting
  in \[N_A = 4 \times {13 \choose 5} = 5148.\]
\item
  To find the probabilities of each of these, we need to know the total
  number of \(5\) card hands. We do not consider order, and so
  \(N = \binom{52}{5} = 2598960\). Then, the probability is simply the
  number of combinations (calculated above) divided by the number of
  hands. This gives, for straights,
  \[P(A) = \frac{10240}{2598960} = \frac{128}{32487} \approx 0.00394,\]
  and for flushes,
  \[P(A) = \frac{5148}{2598960} = \frac{33}{16660} \approx 0.00198.\] As
  a result, we see that straights are roughly twice as common as flushes
  are.\footnotemark{}
\item
  Note that to form a straight flush, we first have to fix a suit. There
  are \({4\choose 1}=4\) total ways of doing this. Next, we need to pick
  which starting value we will use. Once a card has been selected as a
  starting value, the remaining cards are fixed. The start value ranges
  from A through to \(10\). Correspondingly, we have
  \[N_A = {4\choose 1}{10 \choose 1} = 4\times10 = 40.\] As a result, we
  get that \[P(A) = \frac{40}{2598960} = \frac{1}{64974}.\]
\item
  From (d) exactly \(40\) of the straights and \(40\) of the flushes are
  also straight flushes. We can thus remove \(40\) from the totals of
  each of these, giving \(\frac{10200}{2598960}\) for straights and
  \(\frac{5108}{2598960}\) for flushes.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{This is \emph{still} a deeply unintuitive result to me. To
me it feels like it should be harder to get a nice ordering of cards all
in a row than it is to find ones of the same suit. And yet, it is about
twice as likely to have the straights. Now, if you think about this
deeply, it makes a lot of sense: there is a lot more leeway in selecting
the straight than the flush. However, my brain refuses to accept this as
intuitive. This is something that can often occur in probability
questions where the true results can be far from what we would expect.
An interesting question is how long does a straight have to be to be
less likely than a flush of the same length. Note that the number of
ways of choosing a flush will always be \(4\times\binom{13}{k}\), and
the number of ways of forming a straight will always be
\(10\times 4^k\). If we consider \(k\) from \(1\) to \(13\), we can take
the ratios of these to see just how much more (or less) likely a
straight is. Doing this gives: {k=1 gives 0.769. k=2 gives 0.513. k=3
gives 0.559. k=4 gives 0.895. k=5 gives 1.989. k=6 gives 5.967. k=7
gives 23.869. k=8 gives 127.304. k=9 gives 916.587. k=10 gives 9165.874.
k=11 gives 134432.821. k=12 gives 3226387.692. k=13 gives 167772160.} Up
to (and including) \(4\) cards the straight is indeed harder to achieve.
However, this does not last long!}

\chapter{Probabilities with More than One
Event}\label{probabilities-with-more-than-one-event}

\section{Marginal and Joint
Probabilities}\label{marginal-and-joint-probabilities}

Up until this point we have primarily focused on assigning probabilities
to particular events. If we have some event of interest, \(A\), then
\(P(A)\) is the probability that \(A\) occurs in any manner. If we are
using our equally likely probability model, then
\(P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N}\). This is the probability of the event \(A\)
where nothing else is known at all. If we smooth over anything which
could alter the likelihood, if we have no additional information, if we
want the best guess for the likelihood of occurrence in a vacuum, this
is the probability of interest. We refer to such quantities as marginal
probabilities.

\begin{definition}[Marginal
Probability]\protect\hypertarget{def-marginal-probability}{}\label{def-marginal-probability}

The marginal probability of a single event, \(A\), is the probability
that the event happens without considering any information. This is
simply the probability that the event happens, denoted \(P(A)\).

\end{definition}

It is useful to specifically call these marginal probabilities to
differentiate them from probabilities which depend on two or more
events. Specifically, we can think about taking the intersection of two
events, say \(A \cap B\). In words this is the event that \(A\) occurs
\textbf{and} \(B\) occurs. Until this point we have thought about
solving for probabilities related to intersections as a two-step
procedure: first, find an event \(C = A \cap B\), and then second solve
for the marginal probability of \(C\). While this is a useful technique
for calculation, sometimes it is more useful to think of the probability
of the intersection as the probability of \(A\) and \(B\) occurring
simultaneously. We call this the joint probability of \(A\) and \(B\).

\begin{definition}[Joint
Probability]\protect\hypertarget{def-joint-probability}{}\label{def-joint-probability}

The joint probability of two events, \(A\) and \(B\), is given by the
probability of their intersection. That is, \(P(A\cap B)\). This is
sometimes denoted \(P(A,B)\) and corresponds to the probability that
both \(A\) and \(B\) occur. The joint probability of more than two
events extends in the same way. Suppose there exists a sequence of
events, \(A_1, \dots, A_n\), then the joint probability of these events
is \[P(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n) = P\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\right).\]

\end{definition}

\section{What are Conditional
Probabilities?}\label{what-are-conditional-probabilities}

Marginal probabilities are often of interest, and frequently are the
best tool for summarizing the overall state of the world, or our
knowledge regarding the state of the world. Joint probabilities can be
useful when working with compound events, or thinking of complex
outcomes that we wish to consider. However, there are many scenarios
which are not covered by either the joint or marginal probabilities we
have seen. In practice we know that sometimes information that we have
will change our understanding of the probability of an event. Suppose
the event \(A\) corresponds to the event that it snows tomorrow, in some
particular city. It is possible to think about how often it snows on
average, and report a value related to that as \(P(A)\). Now, what if we
know that it is currently the middle of summer? In this case, while
\(P(A)\) does not shrink to \(0\), it becomes far less likely than if we
did not have that information. Similarly, if we know that it is winter,
the likelihood that it snows tomorrow increases. In order to formally
capture this we can introduce the idea of conditional probability.

\begin{definition}[Conditional
Probability]\protect\hypertarget{def-conditional-probability}{}\label{def-conditional-probability}

The conditional probability of an event \(A\) given an event \(B\), is
the probability that \(A\) occurs assuming that we know that \(B\)
occurs. The conditional probability takes into account additional
information codified through the occurrence of an additional event. We
write this quantity as \(P(A|B)\), and will read this as ``the
probability of \(A\) given \(B\).''

\end{definition}

Unlike in the case of marginal probabilities, conditional probabilities
allow us to \emph{condition} on extra pieces of information. Instead of
asking ``what is the probability of this event'', we instead ask,
``given that we know this piece of information, what is the probability
of this event?'' Joint probabilities ask ``what is the probability that
both of these events occur simultaneously'' which is distinct in that we
do not have any additional information about the state of the world when
working with joint probabilities. The subtle distinction becomes quite
powerful, both in terms of manipulating and working with probabilities,
but also in terms of expressing the correct events of interest for
ourselves.

To make use of conditional probabilities, we will think of the process
of \emph{conditioning} on one or more events. We will talk of the
probability of \(A\) conditional on \(B\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are two
events of interest. Intuitively, this it the probability of \(A\)
happening, supposing that we know that \(B\) has already happened.

\begin{example}[Six from the
Sum]\protect\hypertarget{exm-basic-conditional-probability}{}\label{exm-basic-conditional-probability}

Charles and Sadie are playing a new game using two dice. In the game
they each take turns rolling the two dice into a container that the
other player cannot see. They add up the dice and then report this sum
to the other player. The other player then has to guess whether or not
there is a six showing.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  On one round, Charles does not hear the sum that Sadie reports as he
  was not paying attention. Sadie is strict and insists that she will
  not repeat herself. What should Charles guess?
\item
  Determine a strategy which optimizes the likelihood that the guessing
  player will be correct.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  In this case we want the \textbf{marginal probability} of a six
  showing up on the roll of two dice. Take \(E\) to represent the event
  wherein at least one six is showing on the roll of two dice. Thus,
  \(E^C\) is the event that no sixes are showing. There are
  \(5\times 5=25\) (using the product rule for counting) ways of
  \emph{not} rolling a \(6\), meaning that
  \$\(P(E^C) = \frac{25}{36} \implies P(E) = 1 - \frac{25}{36} = \frac{11}{36}\).
  Thus, Charles should guess that there is no \(6\) as the probability
  is only \(11/36 \approx 0.31\).
\item
  Here we wish to determine conditional probabilities. We take \(E\) to
  be the event that at least one \(6\) is showing, and then \(S\) to be
  a variable representing the sum of the two dice. For
  \(s= 1, \dots, 12\) we wish to find \(P(E|\{S=s\})\). Notice that for
  \(s=2,\dots,6\) \(P(E|S=s) = 0\). If the sum is \(2\) we know that
  there could not have been a \(6\). Moreover, for \(s=11,12\) we know
  that \(P(E|S=s) = 1\) since the only way to form \(11\) is a five and
  a six, and the only way to form \(12\) is to have two sixes. This
  leaves \(s = 7,\dots,10\) to check. The following table gives the set
  of values, the possible combinations to reach the value, and then the
  combinations that end up involving a \(6\).

\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Recall that \(A\) and \(B\), as events, are merely subsets of the sample
space, \(\mathcal{S}\). Each item in either \(A\) or \(B\) is one of the
possible outcomes from the experiment or process that we are observing.
Suppose that we know that \(B\) has occurred. What this means is that,
one of the outcomes in the set \(B\) was the observed outcome from the
experiment. Now, if we want to know \(P(A|B)\), we want to know the
probability, working from the assumption that \(B\) has happened, that
\(A\) also happens. That is, knowing that \(B\) has happened, what is
the probability that \(A\) and \(B\) both happen.

The event that \(A\) and \(B\) both happen is denoted by the
intersection, \(A \cap B\). This corresponds to the set of events inside
the set \(B\) which also belong to the set \(A\). Now, instead of
considering the joint probability directly, we need to acknowledge that
for \(A|B\), only the events in \(B\) were possible. That is, instead of
being divided by the whole space, we can only divide by the space of
\(B\). In some sense, we can view conditioning on \(B\) as treating
\(B\) as though it is the full sample space, and finding probabilities
within that. In general, \(B\) will be smaller than \(\mathcal{S}\), and
so \(P(B) < 1\). Instead of the conditional probability being ``out of''
\(1\), it will instead be ``out of'' \(P(B)\), which gives
\(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Computing Conditional Probabilities}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

For an event \(A\), and an event \(B\) with probability \(P(B) > 0\),
the conditional probability of \(A\) given \(B\) is
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

To make this more clear, let's consider a simple example. Suppose that
we take \(A\) to be the event that a \(2\) is rolled on a fair,
six-sided die, and \(B\) to be the event that an even number was rolled.
This is an equal probability model, and so each outcome gets
\(\frac{1}{6}\) probability. The original sample space is
\(\mathcal{S} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), the event \(A\) is \(\{2\}\), and the
event \(B\) is \(\{2,4,6\}\). In order for both \(A\) and \(B\) to
occur, we note that we need \(A \cap B = \{2\}\). If we know that \(B\)
has occurred, then we know that either a \(2\), \(4\), or \(6\) has been
rolled, with equal probability for each. Thus, intuitively, we can view
\(B\) as the new sample space, and say that rolling a \(2\) has a
\(\frac{1}{3}\) probability, given that there are \(3\) outcomes and
\(1\) of them is the event of interest. Another way to consider this is
to note that \(P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\), and so we need to scale each event
by \(\frac{1}{1/2}\) in order to make sure that the total probability of
our reduced sample space equals \(1\). Then
\(P(A\cap B) = \frac{1}{6}\), so
\[P(A|B) = \frac{1/6}{1/2} = \frac{1}{3}.\]

Suppose that, instead of a fair die, it was weighted so that \(6\) comes
up more frequently than the other options. Consider the probability of
observing a six to be \(0.5\), with the other five values each coming up
with probability \(0.10\). If \(A\) and \(B\) are the same events as
above, then \(P(B) = 0.7\). If we know that \(B\) has occurred then the
new sample space is \(\{2,4,6\}\) where
\(P(2) = \frac{0.1}{0.7} = \frac{1}{7}\), \(P(4) = \frac{0.1}{0.7}\),
and \(P(6) = \frac{0.5}{0.7} = \frac{5}{7}\). Note that these three
probabilities sum to \(1\) still, which constitutes a valid probability
model, and so \(P(A|B) = \frac{1}{7}\).

\begin{example}[Six from the Sum -
Revisited]\protect\hypertarget{exm-basic-conditional-probability-rev}{}\label{exm-basic-conditional-probability-rev}

Sadie sees the solution worked out for the best strategy in the dice
game above, but is having trouble understanding it in the context of
conditional probability more broadly. For the sums \(7, 8, 9\), and
\(10\), describe the process of limiting the sample space to get the
correct conditional probability, and use the formula to show that the
probabilities worked out in
Example~\ref{exm-basic-conditional-probability} are correct.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

The relevant table of solutions is copied from above.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Value & Combinations & Involving 6 \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
7 & (1,6) (2,5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) & (1, 6) (6, 1) \\
8 & (2,6) (3,5) (4, 4) (5, 3) (6, 2) & (2, 6) (6, 2) \\

10 & (4, 6) (5, 5) (6, 4) & (4, 6) (6, 4) \\
\end{longtable}

Here, given a sum, we \textbf{know} that one of the events listed under
``combinations'' has occurred. As a result, once we have conditioned on
what the sum is, we are able to treat the ``combinations'' column as the
full sample space of possible outcomes. Each of these in this case is
equally likely, and so we can divide the number which contain a \(6\),
by the total number in the reduced sample space.

To do this algebraically, we first note that \begin{align*}
    P(S=7) &= \frac{6}{36} \\
    P(S=8) &= \frac{5}{36} \\
    P(S=9) &= \frac{4}{36} \\
    P(S=10) &= \frac{3}{36}.
\end{align*} Now, suppose we consider the event \(E\cap\{S=7\}\). This
is the set \(\{(1,6),(6,1)\}\) and so \(P(E\cap\{S=7\}) = 2/36\). In
fact, the same holds true for all of the joint events. As a result, we
get \begin{align*}
    P(E|S=7) &= \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{6}{36}} = \frac{2}{6} \\
    P(E|S=8) &= \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{5}{36}} = \frac{2}{5} \\
    P(E|S=9) &= \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{4}{36}} = \frac{2}{4} \\
    P(E|S=10) &= \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{3}{36}} = \frac{2}{3}.
\end{align*} This corresponds exactly to the values we found before.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Sometimes, we wish to condition on more than one event. To do so, the
same process extends naturally. For instance, suppose we want to know
the probability of \(A\) given \(B\) and \(C\). This would be written
\[P(A|B,C) = \frac{P(A\cap B\cap C)}{P(B \cap C)} = \frac{P(A,B,C)}{P(B,C)}.\]
Moving beyond two events occurs in the expected way.

\section{Using Conditional
Probabilities}\label{using-conditional-probabilities}

Conditional probability is a mechanism for capturing our knowledge of
the world, and using that to update our sense of the uncertainties at
play. For instance, suppose that we are interested in drawing a random
card from a deck of \(52\), and we want to know the probability that it
is a heart. Without any additional knowledge, the probability of this
event is \(\frac{1}{4}\). Now, suppose that you know that it is a red
card. In this case, we now know that it is either a heart or a diamond,
and there are equal numbers of each, meaning that the new probability is
\(0.5\). We can work this out directly
\[P(\text{Heart}|\text{Red}) = \frac{P(\text{Heart},\text{Red})}{P(\text{Red})} = \frac{P(\text{Heart})}{1/2} = \frac{1/4}{1/2} = 0.5.\]
Suppose instead that we had been told that the card was an ace. Here we
now know that there are four possible outcomes that correspond to an
ace, and only one of these is a heart, meaning the probability is
\(\frac{1}{4}\). In this case, \(P(A|B) = P(A)\), and our beliefs did
not update.

What if instead we had considered the second event to be ``the card was
a spade.'' In this case if we want to know \(P(A|B)\) then, given a
spade being drawn, we know that the probability of drawing a heart is
\(0\).

\begin{example}[Charles's Mismatched Urn
Mishap]\protect\hypertarget{exm-conditional-probability-urn}{}\label{exm-conditional-probability-urn}

Charles's love of probability prompts a spontaneous decision: buy an urn
and some coloured balls to fill it up with. Unfortunately, the supplier
of the balls misunderstood the request and sent over an assortment of
different shapes rather than just spheres. There are some spheres, some
cubes, some pyramids, and some cones. There are also five different
colours present, red, blue, green, yellow, and black. Charles is
slightly dismayed as, when reaching into the urn, it is very easy to
feel what shape you are pulling out before you see the object, and the
distribution of colour-shape combinations is not even. Despite the
dismay, Charles shows Sadie, who is deeply excited, explaining how this
mismatched urn is perfect for understanding conditional probabilities
deeply. The distribution of shapes and colours is presented in the
following table.

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Note that there are \(2+3+2=7\) red, \(1+6=7\) blue, \(2+2+1+2=7\)
  green, \(4+2+1=7\) yellow, and \(3+1+1+2=7\) black objects. As a
  result, each colour is going to be equally likely, with a probability
  of \(0.2\).
\item
  Take \(S\), \(C\), \(P\), \(Cn\) to be the events that a sphere, cube,
  pyramid, or cone are drawn, respectively. Take \(R\), \(B\), \(G\),
  \(Y\), \(Bk\) to be the events that a red, blue, green, yellow, or
  black object is drawn, respectively. We want the probability of each
  colour, given the corresponding shape. There are a total of \(20\)
  conditional probabilities to solve for here. We walk through, in full,
  the first conditional probability calculation. Afterwards, the same
  process follows to get the (provided) answer.

  First note that there are \(8\) spheres, \(10\) cubes, \(6\) pyramids,
  and \(11\) cones. Thus, the marginal probabilities are
  \(P(S) = 8/35\), \(P(C) = 10/35\), \(P(P) = 6/35\), and
  \(P(Cn) = 11/35\). Note further that the joint probability between any
  colour-shape combination is going to be given by the number of that
  combination that exist, divided by \(35\). Thus, suppose we want
  \(P(R|S)\). There are \(2\) red spheres, so \(P(R \cap S) = 2/35\).
  The marginal probability \(P(S) = 8/35\), so taken together this gives
  \[P(R|S) = \frac{2/35}{8/35} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}.\]

  Applying the same process gives the following probabilities, reported
  in the table for convenience.

\subsection{The Multiplication Rule}\label{the-multiplication-rule}

While sometimes we will want to work out the conditional probability
using our knowledge of the joint and marginal probabilities, there are
other times where it is easier to determine the conditional probability
directly. In these settings we may wish to understand the marginal or
joint probabilities. That is, we may know \(P(A|B)\), but we want to
make statements regarding \(P(A)\) or \(P(A,B)\).

To do so, we can simply rearrange the defining relationship of
conditional probability, to solve for the quantities of interest.
Because of the importance of this procedure, we actually give this
mostly straightforward rearrangement a special name.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Multiplication Rule}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

The multiplication rule states that, for two events \(A\) and \(B\)
where \(P(B) > 0\), \[P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B).\]

\end{tcolorbox}

Note that, by multiplying both sides of the definition of \(P(A|B)\) by
\(P(B)\) gives the result. In words it states that we can solve for the
joint probability of \(A\) and \(B\) by multiplying the conditional
probability of \(A\) given \(B\), by the marginal probability of \(B\).
This is symmetric in \(A\) and \(B\) so that
\[P(A\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A).\] This is useful as sometimes it is easier to
determine \(B\) given \(A\).

\begin{example}[Package Delivery
Times]\protect\hypertarget{exm-package-delivery-times}{}\label{exm-package-delivery-times}

To thank Sadie for the help in seeing the silver lining with the urn
mishap, Charles decides to order a small gift online, sending it direct
to Sadie. Unfortunately, the website does not list which delivery
company each package is sent out with. After some sleuthing, Charles
determines that there are two different companies that it may have been
sent with. Looking at online reviews it appears as though company \(A\)
is late \(75\%\) of the time while company \(B\) is late \(15\%\) of the
time.

If the store that Charles ordered from sends out \(10\%\) of packages
with company \(A\), and the rest with company \(B\), which is more
likely: that the package is late and was sent with \(A\), or that the
package was late and sent with \(B\)?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We will take \(L\) to correspond to the events where the package is
late, \(A\) to the events where the package was sent with \(A\) and
\(B\) to be the events where the package was sent with \(B\). We wish to
compare \(P(L, A)\) and \(P(L, B)\). We know that \(P(A) = 0.1\) and
\(P(B) = 0.9\), and we know that \(P(L|A) = 0.75\) and
\(P(L|B) = 0.15\). As a result, we can use the multiplication rule to
find the joint probabilities. First,
\(P(L, A) = P(L|A)P(A) = (0.75)(0.1) = 0.075\). Additionally,
\(P(L, B) = P(L|B)P(B) = (0.15)(0.9) = 0.135\). As a result it is more
likely to have the package late and sent with \(B\) then the package
late and sent with \(A\).\footnotemark{}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Note, this is another result which seems to (on the
surface) defy expectations. We will see this again later on in this
chapter in a slightly different context. It seems strange that company
\(A\) is more likely to be late, and yet, we are more likely to see a
late package that is sent by company \(B\) then a late package that is
sent by company \(A\). The reason for this is that company \(B\) is used
much more frequently than company \(A\), which overcomes the added
likelihood of company \(A\) being late.}

\end{example}

\subsection{Partitions and the Law of Total
Probability}\label{partitions-and-the-law-of-total-probability}

While the multiplication rule gives us the capacity to solve for joint
probabilities, often we wish to make statements regarding marginal
probabilities. Fortunately, we can extend this process outlined in the
multiplication rule to solve directly for marginal probabilities as
well. To do so, we first introduce the concept of a partition.

\begin{definition}[Partition]\protect\hypertarget{def-partition}{}\label{def-partition}

A partition is a collection of sets which divide up the sample space
such that all of the sets are disjoint from one another, and the sample
space is given by the union of all of the sets. That is,
\(A_1,\dots,A_n\) is a partition of \(\mathcal{S}\) if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset\) for all \(i \neq j\), and
\item
  \[\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i = \mathcal{S}.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

For instance, if the sample space were all the positive integers, we
could partition this space into all the even numbers as one set and all
the odd numbers as a second. We could also partition this into the set
of numbers which are less than \(10\), the set of numbers that are
greater than \(10\), and then \(10\). In both examples we have sets
whose union forms the full sample space with no overlap. Note that we
could not partition the set into multiples of \(2\) and multiples of
\(3\), since (i) not all values are contained between these two
sets,\footnote{For instance, \(5\) is neither a multiple of \(2\) nor of
  \(3\).} and (ii) there is overlap between these two sets.\footnote{For
  instance, \(6\) is a multiple of both \(2\) and \(3\).}

\begin{example}[Partitions of the Coin
Game]\protect\hypertarget{exm-simple-partitions}{}\label{exm-simple-partitions}

Charles and Sadie are thinking back with fondness to their original coin
flipping game, where they would toss a coin three times in a row. If two
or more heads showed up, Charles would pay. Otherwise, Sadie would.

To help them reminisce, Write down three different partitions of the
sample space, each with a different number of partitioning sets.
Describe your partitions using words.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

There are many possible partitions to write down. The following are
examples.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  We can partition the space into games where Charles pays and games
  where Sadie pays. This gives \begin{align*}
  B_1 &= \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H})\}\\
  B_2 &= \{(\text{T},\text{T},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T})\}.\end{align*}
\item
  We can partition the space into those with \(0\), \(1\), \(2\), or
  \(3\) heads. This gives \begin{align*}
  B_1 &= \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\}\\
  B_2 &= \{(\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T})\}\\
  B_3 &= \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H})\}\\
  B_4 &= \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\}.
  \end{align*}
\item
  We can partition the space into the number of times the sequence
  switches between heads and tails. There will be either \(0\) switches,
  \(1\) switch, or \(2\) switches. This gives \begin{align*}
  B_1 &= \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\}\\
  B_2 &= \{(\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H})\}\\
  B_3 &= \{(\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}),  (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H})\}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Partitions allow us to move from discussions regarding the joint
probability of events to the marginal probability of an event. Suppose
that we have a partition given by \(B_1, B_2, \dots\). This means that
our full sample space can be cut up into these various non-overlapping
sets, and every single outcome belongs to exactly one of them. Now,
suppose we are interested in some other event \(A\). We can ask: how can
\(A\) occur, in terms of the events \(B_1, B_2, \dots\)? Since every
single event in the sample space belongs to exactly one of our
partitioning sets, then it \textbf{must} be the case that every single
event in \(A\) belongs to exactly one of our partitioning sets. This
means that if we consider \(A\cap B_j\), for all \(j\), then every
single event in \(A\) must belong to exactly one of these. In other
words, it must be the case that \[A = \bigcup_{j} A\cap B_j,\] for any
partition \(B_1, B_2,\dots\). Moreover, every single \(A\cap B_j\) is
disjoint from every other \(A \cap B_\ell\), whenever \(\ell \neq j\).
This means that we can use the axiom of additivity to give
\[P(A) = P\left(\bigcup_{j} A\cap B_j\right) = \sum_{j} P(A \cap B_j).\]
In other words: the marginal probability of \(A\) can be found by
summing over \textbf{all} joint probabilities between \(A\) and sets
that form a partition. This argument gives the law of total probability.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-basic-partition}This graphic shows the argument that
summing over the joint probabilities between an event and a partition
gives the full marginal probability. Note that \(B_1,\dots,B_7\) forms a
partition of the space where every possible outcome is contained in
exactly one of these sets. Then, if we take an arbitrary event \(A\), we
can divide \(A\) into the components that intersect with each
partitioning set, namely \(A \cap B_1\), \(A \cap B_2\), and so forth.}

Given a partition, \(B_1, B_2, \dots\), and an event \(A\), the law of
total probability states that
\[P(A) = \sum_i P(A, B_i) = \sum_i P(A|B_i)P(B_i).\]

\end{tcolorbox}

Intuitively, since the whole sample space is divided into the different
\(B_i\)s, this rule breaks down the calculation of \(A\) happening into
manageable chunks. Each term in the summation is ``the probability that
\(A\) happens, given \(B_i\) happening'' weighted by how likely it is
that \(B_i\) happens. Then by summing over all possible \(B_i\), we know
that we must be capturing all possible ways that \(A\) can occur since
all parts of the sample space are contained in exactly one of the sets
of our partition. The law of total probability is an indispensible tool
for computing probabilities in practice.

\begin{example}[Sadie's Possibly Late
Package]\protect\hypertarget{exm-lotp-example}{}\label{exm-lotp-example}

Sadie has still not received the package that Charles had ordered. While
it is not late yet, Charles decides to figure out the probability that
the package will end up being late. Recall that company \(A\) is late
\(75\%\) of the time while company \(B\) is late \(15\%\) of the time,
and the store that Charles ordered from sends out \(10\%\) of packages
with company \(A\), and the rest with company \(B\), which is more
likely.

What is the probability that the package is late?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Note that \(A, B\) forms a partition of the sample space as every
package is either sent with \(A\) or with \(B\), and no package can be
sent with both. Further, if \(L\) represents the event that the package
is late, then we know that \(P(L|A) = 0.75\) and \(P(L|B) = 0.15\).
Since \(P(A) = 0.1\) and \(P(B) = 0.9\), an application of the law of
total probability gives
\[P(L) = P(L|A)P(A) + P(L|B)P(B) = (0.75)(0.1) + (0.15)(0.9) = 0.21.\]
As a result, knowing nothing else, the package has a probability of
\(0.21\) of being late.

\begin{example}[Charles' Many
Urns]\protect\hypertarget{exm-lotp-example-two}{}\label{exm-lotp-example-two}

While shopping at some garage sales one Sunday morning, Charles and
Sadie stumble across a wonderful find! They see three urns which are
\textbf{exactly} identical to the one that Charles had already purchased
to store the different balls which turned out to not be balls at all.
Realizing the opportunity they splurge and purchase them all, and then
divide the various objects between the four urns, placing all the
spheres in one container, all the cubes in another, all the pyramids in
a third, and all the cones in a fourth.

Once done, they use a different selection mechanism. First, they pick an
urn at random. Next, they random grab one of the items from within it.
The distribution of colours and shapes is included in the following

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Let \(R\), \(B\), \(G\), \(Y\), and \(Bk\) be the events that a red,
  blue, green, yellow, or black ball are selected. Further, let \(U_1\),
  \(U_2\), \(U_3\), and \(U_4\) be the events that the first, second,
  third, or fourth urn are selected. Then note that, according to the
  law of total probability,
  \[P(R) = P(R, U_1) + P(R, U_2) + P(R, U_3) + P(R, U_4) = \sum_{j=1}^4 P(R|U_j)P(U_j).\]
  An equivalent argument holds for each of the other colours. Now,
  \[P(R|U_j) = \frac{N_{R\cap U_j}}{N_{U_j}},\] where \(N_{R\cap U_j}\)
  is the number of red objects in urn \(j\) and \(N_{U_j}\) is the total
  number in urn \(j\). Plugging this in and simplifying we get
  \[P(R) = \sum_{j=1}^4P(R|U_j)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\left\{\frac{2}{8} + \frac{3}{10} + \frac{2}{6}\right\} = \frac{53}{240}.\]

  We can apply analogous arguments to the other colours giving
  \begin{align*}
  P(B) &= \frac{1}{4}\left\{\frac{1}{8} + \frac{6}{11}\right\} = \frac{59}{352} \\
  P(G) &= \frac{1}{4}\left\{\frac{2}{8} + \frac{2}{10} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{11}\right\} = \frac{527}{2640}\\
  P(Y) &= \frac{1}{4}\left\{\frac{4}{10} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{11}\right\} = \frac{34}{165}\\
  P(Bk) &= \frac{1}{4}\left\{\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{11}\right\} = \frac{1087}{5280}.
  \end{align*}

  Note that these probabilities sum to \(1\). In decimal these simplify
  to approximately 0.221, 0.168, 0.2, 0.206, 0.206.
\item
  Using the same setup as before, we have
  \[P(R) = P(R, U_1) + P(R, U_2) + P(R, U_3) + P(R, U_4) = \sum_{j=1}^4 P(R|U_j)P(U_j).\]
  Now \(P(U_1) = 8/35\), \(P(U_2) = 10/35\), \(P(U_3) = 6/35\), and
  \(P(U_4) = 11/35\). Moreover, the conditional probabilities themselves
  do not change, and so instead we have
  \[P(R) = \left\{\frac{2}{8}\cdot\frac{8}{35} + \frac{3}{10}\cdot\frac{10}{35} + \frac{2}{6}\frac{6}{35} + \frac{0}{11}\cdot\frac{11}{35}\right\} = \frac{N_R}{35}.\]
  Note that when multiplying by the marginal probability of the urn, the
  denominator will always cancel. As a result, we end up with the total
  number of reds over \(35\), which leads to \(P(R) = \frac{1}{5}\). The
  same will be true for the other colours, and as a result, if we choose
  the urn based on a weighted selection, this will result in equal
  probability once more.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Bayes' Theorem}\label{bayes-theorem}

We have seen the direct computation of marginal probabilities (while
using an equally likely outcome model), the computation of conditional
probabilities, the use of the multiplication rule for joint
probabilities, and the use of the law of total probability to indirectly
calculate marginal probabilities through conditioning arguments.
Throughout these discussions we have been primarily concerned with
keeping events \(A\) and \(B\) arbitrary. Everything that we have
indicated for \(P(A)\) holds for \(P(B)\), as does \(P(A|B)\) and
\(P(B|A)\). In reality, it will often be the case that conditioning on
one of the events will be natural, while conditioning on the other will
be more tricky. In these events, it can be useful to be able to
transform statements regarding \(P(A|B)\) into statements regarding
\(P(B|A)\), and vice versa.

Note that because the definitions are symmetric,
\[P(A|B)P(B) = P(A,B) = P(B|A)P(A).\] This is an application of the
multiplication rule in two different orientations. If we divide both
sides of the equality by \(P(B)\), assuming that it is not \(0\), then
we get \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.\] Now, if we form a
partition, say \(A,A_2,A_3,\dots\), then we can rewrite \(P(B)\) using
the law of total probability as
\[P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) + \cdots = P(B|A)P(A) + \sum_{i=2}P(B|A_i)P(A_i),\]
which can replace \(P(B)\). Taken together this gives a result known as
Bayes' Theorem.\footnote{Bayes' Theorem is named in the same way that
  the Bayesian interpretation of probability is, and that Bayesian
  statistics is more broadly. The connections are more than merely
  surface: Bayes' Theorem can be viewed as the primary technique with
  which we can update subjective beliefs about the world. Importantly,
  however, even those who use a Frequentist view of statistics accept
  the math of Bayes' Theorem, and use it frequently.}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Bayes' Theorem}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Suppose that there are two events, \(A\) and \(B\), with \(P(B) > 0\).
Moreover, suppose that \(A\) taken with \(A_2, A_3, \dots\) forms a
partition. Then Bayes' Theorem states that
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + \sum_{i=2} P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

Bayes' Theorem allows us to convert statements regarding \(P(B|A)\) into
statements regarding \(P(A|B)\). Note that, as we derived above, Bayes'
Theorem is an application of the multiplication rule and an application
of the law of total probability.\footnote{In fact, I would go as far as
  to suggest that learning Bayes' Theorem by itself is less important
  than fully grasping the definition of conditional probability
  alongside the multiplication rule and the law of total probability. I
  myself do not remember Bayes' Theorem directly, but can write it down
  directly from these definitions without any thought.} Sometimes we may
have \(P(B)\) directly, rendering the law of total probability in the
denominator unnecessary.

Often, the natural partition to select when we do need the law of total
probability is to take \(A\) and \(A^C\). Note that any set with its
complement forms a partition, since by definition they occupy the entire
space and are non-overlapping. When this is done we get the slightly
more compact relationship of
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C)}.\]

Bayes' Theorem differs from our previous relationships as it allows us
to translate one set of conditional probabilities into another. Every
other relationship we have looked at has moved between types of
probabilities, whereas Bayes' Theorem deals directly with conditional
relationships.

The most commonly cited example application is in medical testing.
Suppose that we know the performance characteristics of a particular
medical test: it is \(99\%\) accurate for positive cases, and \(95\%\)
accurate for negative cases. That is, with probability \(0.99\) it
correctly returns positive when an individual is infected, and with
probability \(0.95\) it returns negative when an individual is not
infected.These are both statements of conditional probability. If we
take \(A\) to be the event that the test returns positive, and \(B\) to
be the event that the patient is infected,\footnote{It is worth drawing
  attention to the language that we have started to use at this point in
  the notes regarding ``events''. In this case our sample space would
  actually be formed using pairs of information. In particular, we might
  have
  \[\mathcal{S} = \{(\text{Pos. Test}, \text{Illness}), (\text{Neg. Test}, \text{Illness}),(\text{Pos. Test}, \text{No Illness}),(\text{Neg. Test}, \text{No Illness})\}.\]
  Then the event \(A\) here is actually
  \(A = \{(\text{Pos. Test}, \text{Illness}),(\text{Pos. Test}, \text{No Illness})\}\)
  and \(B\) is
  \(\{(\text{Pos. Test}, \text{Illness}),(\text{Neg. Test}, \text{Illness})\}\).
  It is far more clunky to make explicit these events, and so we move
  towards using more natural language. Until you feel confident that you
  can identify the specific outcomes associated with the events of
  interest, it is worth writing these out in full.} then we are saying
that \(P(A|B) = 0.99\) and \(P(A^C|B^C) = 0.95\) which means that
\(P(A|B^C) = 0.05\). Suppose that we know that, across the entire
population, one in a thousand individuals is likely to be infected. This
means that \(P(B) = 0.001\).

Now if a random individual goes into a doctor's office and tests
positive for the disease, how likely are they to actually be infected?
In this case we want to know the probability of them being infected
given that they have tested positive. In notation, this is \(P(B|A)\).
We do not know this quantity directly, but given an application of
Bayes' Theorem, we can find it. Using the natural partition of \(B\) and
\(B^C\), we get
\[P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(A)}{P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|B^C)P(B^C)} = \frac{(0.99)(0.001)}{(0.99)(0.001)+(0.05)(0.999)} \approx 0.019.\]
That is, despite the fact that this test is exceptionally effective at
detecting this disease, a positive test still means that an individual
has a probability of only \(0.019\) of actually having the
illness.\footnote{This counter intuitive fact was an intensely
  frustrating reality for statisticians everywhere during the height of
  the COVID-19 pandemic, when politicians and the population at large
  turned away from testing owing to its perceived ``ineffectiveness''.
  The quantity of interest for knowing how good a test is is \(P(A|B)\)
  and \(P(A^C|B^C)\). However, if a disease is sufficiently rare, with
  \(P(B)\) sufficiently small, then no matter how effective the tests
  are you will likely have \(P(B|A)\) to be low. Note that
  \(P(B|A) >> P(B)\) in the example, and this will also be true in
  general. A single test cannot say with certainty, however, they are an
  incredibly effective tool at reducing our uncertainty.}

\begin{example}[Sadie's Late
Package]\protect\hypertarget{exm-bayes-theorem}{}\label{exm-bayes-theorem}

Sadie eventually received the package that Charles had sent, but it
arrived very late. Sadie was not home when the package was delivered and
there no obvious markings on the box to indicate which of the two
delivery companies had sent it.

Given this information, and knowing that company \(A\) is late \(75\%\)
of the time while company \(B\) is late \(15\%\) of the time, and the
store that Charles ordered from sends out \(10\%\) of packages with
company \(A\), and the rest with company \(B\), what is the probability
that the package was delivered by each of the two companies?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We want to determine \(P(A|L)\) and \(P(B|L)\). We know that
\(P(L|A) = 0.75\) and \(P(L|B) = 0.15\). Moreover, we know that
\(P(A) = 0.1\) and \(P(B) = 0.9\). Applying Bayes' Theorem directly we
get
\[P(A|L) = \frac{P(L|A)P(A)}{P(L|A)P(A) + P(L|B)P(B)} = \frac{(0.75)(0.10)}{(0.75)(0.10) + (.10)(0.90)} = \frac{5}{11}.\]
Similarly, we get
\[P(B|L) = \frac{P(B|A)P(B)}{P(L|A)P(A) + P(L|B)P(B)} = \frac{(0.15)(0.90)}{(0.75)(0.10) + (.10)(0.90)} = \frac{6}{11}.\]
Note, we could have also used the fact that \(P(A|L) + P(B|L) = 1\) to
determine this. As a result, it is more likely that \(B\) delivered the
package than \(A\).\footnotemark{}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Note that this is another example of a counterintuitive
result. Here, \(A\) is far more likely to be late, but it is more likely
that \(B\) delivered a late package to us than \(A\) because of the
\textbf{base rates}. That is, \(P(B)\) is much higher to begin than
\(P(A)\), and so that is hard to overcome. It is worth noting, however,
that originally \(P(B)\) is \(9\) times more likely than \(P(A)\), and
after knowing that package is late it is \(\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\) times
more likely. This major reduction in the relative likelihood is owed to
how much more likely \(A\) is to deliver late packages than \(B\).}

\end{example}

Bayes' Theorem highlights a key lesson when considering conditional
probabilities, and it's a common mistake to make which should be avoided
at all costs. Namely, we cannot interchange \(P(A|B)\) with \(P(B|A)\).
These probabilities are not necessarily highly correlated with one
another, and it is important to distinguish clearly which is the
probability of interest.\footnote{Mixing up \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(A|B)\) is
  often called \emph{confusion of the inverse}, and it can lead to very
  faulty conclusions when ignored. In the medical testing example above,
  it is important to not confuse ``the probability that the test returns
  positive, assuming you have the illness'' with ``the probability that
  you have the illness, given that the test returns positive.'' This
  type of faulty logic has long been used to justify discriminatory
  behaviour in medicine, the law, and so on. A thorough understanding of
  statistics and probability helps to ensure that these types of errors
  are not made, and gives you the tools to push-back on the spots where
  people are making these arguments incorrectly, particularly when the
  stakes are high or harm is being done.} The stakes of these types of
confusion can be quite high, and it is tremendously important to ensure
that you are conditioning on the correct events. Fortunately, Bayes'
Theorem allows us to translate between events for conditioning, giving a
mechanism from translating between the two.\footnote{When discussing
  Bayes' Theorem we introduced two frequently occurring sources of error
  when reasoning about probabilities, and showed how to remedy them.
  \emph{Confusion of the inverse} occurs when you mix up \(P(A|B)\) with
  \(P(B|A)\), and can lead to disastrous consequences. The \emph{base
  rate fallacy} occurs when you fail to take into account the rareness
  of the marginal events and instead only consider the conditionals
  (such as seeing that delivery company \(A\) was more likely to be late
  than \(B\), without considering that \(B\) was more likely to be used
  than \(A\)). These are both examples of the challenges at the heart of
  probability and statistics: namely, the subjects are fairly
  unintuitive once moving beyond the basics. As a result, we need to
  rely on building up our intuitions over time by making use of the
  formal rules that we are able to derive.}

\section{Independence}\label{independence}

We have seen that, in most cases, conditioning on an event changes the
probability of that event. For instance, if we want to know the
probability it is raining, if we condition on knowing that it is a day
full of gray skies, the conditional probability is likely higher than
the marginal probability. By considering how the marginal and
conditional probabilities differ, we are in effect indicating a
dependence of the events on one another. In terms of probability, this
dependence is captured by an influence on the degree of uncertainty
present depending on what we know.

It is totally possible that two events do not influence one another at
all. The weather outside today is likely not influenced by your
favourite sports team's performance last night.\footnote{Though, perhaps
  the world will freeze over if
  \emph{(insert-your-least-favourite-team-here)} wins the
  \emph{(insert-the-name-of-the-championship-for-the-league-you-care-about-here)}?}
In this case, we would have \(P(A|B) = P(A)\).

We saw an example of this previously when we wanted to know the
probability of a randomly selected card being a heart (\(A\)) given that
it was an ace (\(B\)). We found that this was \(\frac{1}{4}\), exactly
the same as the probability if we did not know that it was an ace. Thus
here we have \(P(A|B)=P(A)\). We could have also said that
\(P(B|A)=P(B)=\frac{1}{13}\). The symmetry of these events makes it
somewhat more convenient to express this relationship differently.

Instead of writing \(P(A|B) = P(A)\) and \(P(B|A) = P(B)\), we can
multiply the first relationship by \(P(B)\) on both sides, or the second
by \(P(A)\) on both sides. The multiplication rule gives
\(P(A|B)P(B) = P(A,B)\), and so the first relationship becomes
\(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\). The second follows exactly the same. Any two
events that satisfy this relationship are said to be independent.

\begin{definition}[Independence]\protect\hypertarget{def-independence}{}\label{def-independence}

Any two events, \(A\) and \(B\), which satisfy \(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\) are
said to be independent. If \(A\) and \(B\) are independent we write
\(A\perp B\), and read ``\(A\) is independent of \(B\)''. Any events
which are not independent are said to be dependent, and we write
\(A\not\perp B\).

\end{definition}

Note that independence is always a symmetric property: if \(A\) is
independent of \(B\), then \(B\) is independent of \(A\). To check
whether two events are independent, we check whether their joint
probability is equal to the product of their marginal probabilities.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Properties of Independence}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Note that if \(A\perp B\), then \(A^C\perp B\), \(A^C\perp B^C\), and
vice versa. To see this note \[P(A^C, B) + P(A, B) = P(B),\] by the Law
of Total Probability. Then, by independence of \(A\) and \(B\) this
gives \begin{align*}
P(A^C, B) + P(A)P(B) &= P(B) \\
\implies P(A^C, B) &= P(B) - P(A)P(B) \\
&= P(B)(1 - P(A)) \\
&= P(B)P(A^C),\end{align*} as is required. The other combinations follow
in the same manner.

\end{tcolorbox}

If \(P(A)\neq 0\), then we can divide both sides by \(P(A)\) to gives
\(P(B|A) = P(B)\). Similarly, if \(P(B)\neq 0\), then we can divide both
sides by \(P(B)\) to give \(P(A|B)=P(A)\). This expression in terms of
conditional probabilities is the more intuitive expression of
independence. It directly captures the idea that ``knowing \(B\) does
not change our belief about \(A\)''. However, we must be careful. This
conditional argument is only valid when the event that is being
conditioned on is not probability \(0\), where the defining
relationship, \(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\), will hold for all events. Recall
that, in general, \(P(A\cap B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cup B)\). It is only when
assuming independence that this simplifies further.

\begin{example}[Independence and Board
Games]\protect\hypertarget{exm-assessing-independence}{}\label{exm-assessing-independence}

Charles and Sadie are invited over to a friends house, Garth, to play
some board games. Both of them are quite excited by this prospect as
board games feel like the next logical step for the two of them, being
as into probability and games as they are! Garth has a large board game
collection, and begins to explain the games to Charles and Sadie across
a variety of axes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Whether the games are competitive or cooperative.
\item
  How many players the games play best at (\(\{1, 2, 3, 4+\}\)).
\item
  How ``heavy'' the games tend to be (friendly for everyone, moderately
  involved, or very heavy).
\end{itemize}

While Garth continues on about several other topics including the
themes, the mechanics, or the rating on BoardGameGeek, Charles drifts
off wondering whether the traits listed are independent in Garth's
collection. Suppose that Garth has \(100\) games, of which:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(25\) are cooperative.
\item
  \(5\) are best played at one player, \(20\) at two, and \(55\) at
  three.
\item
  \(10\) are friendly for everyone and \(45\) are moderately involved.

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  We are suggesting that \(P(A,B) = 0.05\), where \(A\) is ``two
  player'' and \(B\) is ``cooperative''. We know that \(P(B) = 0.25\)
  and \(P(A) = 0.20\). Calculating
  \(P(A)P(B) = (0.20)(0.25) = 0.05 = P(A,B)\), and so these traits
  \textbf{are} independent.
\item
  We have \(P(A,B) = 0.2\) where \(A\) is ``heavy'' and \(B\) is
  ``\(4+\) players. We know that \(P(A) = 0.45\) and \(P(B) = 0.20\),
  and so \(P(A)P(B) = (0.45)(0.20) = 0.09 \neq P(A,B)\). As a result,
  these traits are \textbf{not} independent.
\item
  We know that \(P(A) > 0\) and \(P(B) > 0\) for \(A\) being moderately
  involved and \(B\) being cooperative. As a result, \(P(A)P(B) > 0\),
  and so if \(P(A,B) = 0\), they must \textbf{not} be independent.
\item
  Taking \(A\) to be ``competitive'' we have \(P(A) = 0.75\). Taking
  \(B\) to be ``two player'' we have \(P(B) = 0.20\). As a result, if
  \(A\perp B\) then \(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B) = (0.75)(0.20) = 0.15\). Thus,
  there must be \(15\) competitive, two player games.
\item
  Taking \(A\) to be ``competitive'' we have \(P(A) = 0.75\). Taking
  \(B\) to be ``heavy'' weh ave \(P(B) = 0.45\). Thus, if they were
  independent, we would have
  \(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B) = (0.75)(0.45) = 0.3375\). This would require
  \(33.75\) games to be heavy, competitive games and so we must conclude
  that they are \textbf{not} independent.

\subsubsection{Mutually Exclusive
Events}\label{mutually-exclusive-events}

Importantly, if \(A\perp B\), then \(A\cap B\neq \emptyset\) unless
either \(A=\emptyset\), \(B=\emptyset\), or both. To see this recall
that \(P(\emptyset) = 0\), and so if \(A\cap B = \emptyset\) then
\(P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B) = P(\emptyset) = 0\). This only holds if either
\(P(A) = 0\) or \(P(B) = 0\). This may seem to be a rather technical
point, however, it is the source of much confusion regarding
independence. In particular, it is common to mistake independent events
for mutually exclusive events.

\begin{definition}[Mutually Exclusive
Events]\protect\hypertarget{def-mutually-exclusive-events}{}\label{def-mutually-exclusive-events}

Two events, \(A\) and \(B\) are said to be mutually exclusive if they
are disjoint. In particular, if \(P(A,B) = 0\) then \(A\) and \(B\) are
mutually exclusive. If \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive events,
with \(P(A) > 0\) and \(P(B) > 0\), then \(A\not\perp B\).

\end{definition}

Whenever only one event from a set of events can happen, we refer to the
events as being mutually exclusive. If one happens, we know that the
others did not. Mutually exclusive events are always dependent since
knowing that \(A\) occurs dramatically shifts our belief about
\(B\),\(C\), and \(D\).\footnote{Namely, we know that all of the others
  are then impossible.}

The primary concern with mutually exclusive and independent events is a
linguistic one. We often use words like independent to mean unrelated,
and in a sense, mutually exclusive events are unrelated in that one has
nothing to do with another. However, in statistics and probability, when
we discuss independence, it is not an independence of the events
themselves but rather an independence relating to our beliefs regarding
the uncertainty associated with the events. In this sense, mutually
exclusive events are very informative regarding the uncertainty
associated with them.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Cooking
Dinner]\protect\hypertarget{exm-independence-two}{}\label{exm-independence-two}

Suppose that Charles and Sadie always eat dinner together. It will
either be the case that Charles cooks at home, that Sadie cooks at home,
that the two of them order in, or that they go out to eat. If we take
these to be four events, \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), then are any of
these events independent? Mutually exclusive? Explain.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Assuming, as it seems reasonable given the information in the question,
that only one of the possible tasks occurs for dinner in a night, then
we \emph{know} that
\[P(A,B) = P(A,C) = P(A,D) = P(B,C) = P(B,D) = P(C,D) = 0.\] As a
result, all of the events described are mutually exclusive, and
correspondingly, are \emph{not} independent.

\section{Contingency Tables}\label{contingency-tables}

Through to this point we have discussed probabilities in the abstract,
either through an enumeration of equally likely outcomes, or else by
directly specifying the likelihood of various events. While these are
useful in many regards, we are often looking for more concise manners of
summarizing information of interest. One tool for accomplishing this is
a contingency table.

\begin{definition}[Contingency
Table]\protect\hypertarget{def-contingency-table}{}\label{def-contingency-table}

A contingency table is a tabular summary of information which summarizes
the joint probabilities of two or more variables. Typically a
contingency table will take one factor for the columns and a secondary
factor for the rows, where each cell then represents the frequency with
which observations occur in the two corresponding categories
simultaneously.

\end{definition}

To begin, you could imagine constructing a frequency table relaying the
frequency with which undergraduate students are enrolled in various
faculties at a particular university. This tells you, of the whole
population of students at the university, what is the faculty breakdown.
By dividing the number in each faculty by the total number of students,
you convert the frequencies to proportions, and these proportions can be
viewed as probabilities. (See Table~\ref{tbl-uni-frequency}.\footnote{Note,
  the values in this table are \emph{roughly} inspired by a subset of
  the
  \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20240103124753/https://www.unb.ca/finance/_assets/documents/rpb/factbooktables/2022enrollment/20221215-tablee3-enrolment-ftehc-fac-acad-lvl-2022fa-final.pdf}{Fall
  2022 University of New Brunswick Enrolment Numbers}.}) The
interpretation of proportions as probabilities implies a very specific
statistical experiment. In particular, the proportion represents the
probability that an individual selected at random from the entire
population has the given trait. This is frequently a probability of
interest, which makes these summary tables a useful tool.\footnote{This
  provides further emphasis for the utility of urn models. If you
  imagine an urn that has balls with two or more traits (say like those
  in Example~\ref{exm-conditional-probability-urn}), then randomly
  selecting a single ball from this population has an analogous
  probability distribution.}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-uni-frequency}Frequency and corresponding
proportions of enrolment by faculty in a university.}

\centering{

\begin{tabular}{>{}l|r|r}
\hline
Faculty & Enrolment & Proportion\\
\hline
\textbf{Arts} & 1266 & 0.2182382\\

\hline
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

When a single trait is displayed we refer to these tabular summaries as
frequency tables or frequency distributions. A contingency table instead
plots two or more traits on the same table, with each cell representing
the frequency of both traits occurring simultaneously in the population.
Extending the university example, we may further include the student's
current year of study to see the breakdown of both faculty and year of
study, in one table.

\begin{table}

\hline
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

By including two (or more) factors in the table we are able to capture
not only the marginal probabilities for the population, but also the
joint probabilities for the population, and in turn, the conditional
probabilities for the population. Being able to concisely summarize all
of these concepts regarding traits in a population of interest renders
contingency tables immensely useful in the study of uncertainty broadly.

Consider the two-way contingency table, Table~\ref{tbl-uni-contingency}.
Each cell consists of frequency with which a combination of the two
traits occurs in the population.\footnote{That is, the number of
  students who are enrolled in that faculty, in that year of study.} If
we take events corresponding to each of the levels of the two variables
of interest, then these central cells represent the frequency of joint
events. That is, each interior cell gives the total number of
observations with a set level for variable one\footnote{Faculty.} AND a
set level for variable two\footnote{Year of study.}. For instance, there
are 50 individuals who are in Law and studying in Year 2.

Each row is then summed, with the total number following into the
corresponding row recorded in the right hand margin. each column is
summed, with the total number corresponding to the given column recorded
in the bottom margin. For instance there are a total of 786 students in
Education and a total of 1393 in Year 3. Then the margin totals are
summed and the total is recorded in the lower right margin space (in
this case, 5801). Whether the rows or columns are summed, they should
sum to the same total, which is the total of the population under
consideration. This is the same as simply adding all of the observed
interior frequencies. To turn a frequency into a probability, you need
only divide the correct frequency by the correct total.

\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

For the standard joint probabilities, you take the interior cell count
and divide by the population total. Here we are saying that some fixed
number, \(m\), of the \(N\) total individuals have both traits under
consideration. For instance, the joint probability that a student is in
Law and studying in Year 2 is 0.0086192.\footnote{It is worth
  reemphasizing what this probability actually means. If we were to
  randomly sample, with equal probability, individuals from this
  population then the probability that an individual selected has both
  the faculty and year specified is given by the joint probability. That
  is to say, if we did this over and over and over again (with
  replacement) in the long-term, these probabilities represent
  proportion of time those combinations would be observed.} If instead
you wish to find a marginal probability, you have to consider the value
in the corresponding margin: this is the total number of individuals
with the given trait, ignoring the level of the other variable. These
marginal values are also divided by the total population size. For
instance, there is a 0.1354939 probability of observing a student in
Education and a probability 0.240131 of observing a student in Year 3.

Outside of joint and marginal probabilities, we can also find
conditional probabilities. To do so, we restrict our focus to either
only one row, or one column. Then, we can take the joint cell and divide
by the value in the margin, which gives the conditional probability of
interest. Note, this works with \emph{either} the contingency table
directly \textbf{or} with the propensity table. The reasoning is that
the propensity table divided by the same totals in the numerator and the
denominator. Suppose we take some cell, \(A\cap B\), which has
\(N_{A, B}\) in the contingency table. Then,
\[P(A\cap B) = \frac{N_{A, B}}{N} \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad P(B) = \frac{N_B}{N}.\]
If we consider then forming \(P(A|B)\) we get
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{N_{A \cap B}/\cancel{N}}{N_B/\cancel{N}} = \frac{N_{A, B}}{N_B}.\]
Thus, given that we know a student is in Education, then the probability
that they are in Year 3 is approximately 0.2341.

Note that these procedures are exactly in line with what we had seen
before. The conditional probability is defined as the joint probability
divided by the marginal probability. The process of computing the
marginal can be seen as an application of the law of total probability.
As a result, contingency tables can be a useful, tangible tool for
investigating the techniques we have been discussing: they are not a
substitute for direct manipulation of the mathematical objects, but they
can present insight into the underlying processes where it may be hard
to derive that insight otherwise.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Law of Total Probability: Contingency Table's Version}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Recall that the law of total probability states that, if
\(B_1,\dots,B_n\) forms a partition of the sample space, then
\[P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A|B_i)P(B_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A, B_i)\]. In a
contingency table it is easier to see how either of the two factors at
play (either those in the rows or the columns) forms a partition of the
space. Every observation has to fall in exactly one row and exactly one
column. Thus, if we want to know the marginal frequency of a single
trait (say represented by some row of the table), then one way to find
this total is to sum up every observation in each of the corresponding
columns. This is \emph{precisely} the same process as the law of total
probability. Note that, denoting each column as \(B_i\), and supposing
there are \(k\) total columns, then the total number in a row is taken
to be \[N_A = \sum_{i=1}^k N_{A, B_i},\] simply as the summation of the
corresponding row. By definition, \(P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N}\), and so
dividing both sides by \(N\) gives
\[P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^k N_{A, B_i} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{N_{A, B_i}}{N} = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A\cap B_i).\]

\end{tcolorbox}

It is important to note that there is redundant information within a
contingency table. For instance, the margins need not be listed
explicitly, as they can be directly calculated from the interior points.
Same goes for interior points, given the margins of the table (assuming
\emph{some} interior points are also presented). This can be useful for
a compact representation of the information, and manipulating these
tables -- being able to find the required information in many places --
should become familiar to you as you continue to work with them more and
more.

\begin{example}[The Evolving Contents of Charle's
Urns]\protect\hypertarget{exm-charles-contingency-table}{}\label{exm-charles-contingency-table}

After learning of contingency tables, Sadie points out to Charles that
with the whole urn debacle they went through, the two of them actually
ended up using a contingency table to summarize the information. How
neat! In the interim, there has been some development in the contents of
Charles's urns, and armed with the new knowledge of contingency tables,
the following summary is produced.

  \item
    For \(A\) we can note that \(2 + A + 1 + 3 = 10\), which gives that
    \(A = 4\). We could have also tried a column sum, however, this
    would involve \(3\) unknowns and so would not have given a numeric
    result.
  \item
    For \(B\) either a row sum or column sum would produce the correct
    answer. We either take \(3 + 3 + B + 5 = 15\) giving \(B = 4\) or
    \(1 + 1 + B + 3 + 4 = 13\) giving \(B=4\).
  \item
    \(C\) is more challenging as we either have that
    \(2 + C + 3 + 2 = D\) or \(4 + 2 + 3 + C + 3 = E\)\footnotemark{} As
    a result, for this technique we will need to find either \(D\) or
    \(E\) first. There is an alternative technique to use, which would
    be to note that we have \emph{all} the internal points specified at
    this point, and we know that these sum to \(50\). As a result, we
    could note that \(C = 50 - 10 - 5 - 15 - 13 - 2 - 3 - 2 = 0\) or
    that \(C =  50 - 13 - 13 - 12 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 3 = 0\).
  \item
    We can find \(D\) either by subtracting from the total,
    \(D = 50 - 10 - 5 - 15 - 13 = 7\), or by adding along the row,
    \(2 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 7\).\footnotemark{} Note that with \(D = 7\), had
    we not found \(C = 0\) above, we could now take
    \(2 + C + 3 + 2 = 7\) and find \(C = 0\).
  \item
    Like \(D\), we have two options for working this out. Either
    \(E = 50 - 13 - 13 - 12 = 12\) or
    \(E = 4 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 3 = 12\).\footnotemark{} Like with \(D\), had
    we solved for \(E\) first, then we could find \(C\) via
    \(4 + 2 + 3 + C + 3 = 12\).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Here we want \(P(\text{Black}, \text{Cube})\). This is given by the
  frequency of black cubes divided by \(50\). Thus,
  \[P(\text{Black}, \text{Cube}) = \frac{A}{50} = \frac{4}{50} = 0.08.\]
\item
  Here we want \(P(\text{Red})\). This is given by the marginal
  frequency of red objects divided by \(50\). Thus,
  \[P(\text{Red}) = \frac{D}{50} = \frac{7}{50} = 0.14.\]
\item
  Here we want \(P(\text{Cube})\). This is given by the marginal
  frequency of cubes divided by \(50\). Thus,
  \[P(\text{Cube}) = \frac{E}{50} = \frac{12}{50} = 0.24.\]
\item
  Here we want \(P(\text{Green}|\text{Pyramid})\). This is given by the
  frequency of green pyramids divided by the marginal frequency of
  pyramids. Thus
  \[P(\text{Green}|\text{Pyramid}) = \frac{B}{13} = \frac{4}{13} \approx 0.308.\]
\item
  Here we want \(P(\text{Pyramid}|\text{Green})\). This is given by the
  frequency of green pyramids divided by the marginal frequency of green
  objects.\footnotemark{} Thus
  \[P(\text{Pyramid}|\text{Green}) = \frac{B}{15} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.267.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Note here, \(A=4\) has been filled in.}

\footnotetext{We have filled in \(C = 0\) here.}

\footnotetext{This uses \(A=4\) and \(C=0\).}

\footnotetext{Note, we could also apply Bayes' Theorem to find the
result here. We know that \(P(\text{Green}|\text{Pyramid}) = 4/13\),
that \(P(\text{Green}) = 15/50\) and that \(P(\text{Pyramid}) = 13/50\).
Thus, Bayes' Theorem gives
\[P(\text{Pyramid}|\text{Green}) = \frac{(4/13)(13/50)}{15/50} = \frac{4}{15},\]
exactly as in the direct derivation.}

\end{example}

It is also important to recognize that independence and mutually
exclusive events can be codified via the table as well. Zeros on the
interior points indicate events which are mutually exclusive: if we know
that one of them occurred, we also know that the other one did not. For
independence, it requires a degree of solving proportions. We can either
check that the joint probability (\(N_{A,B}/N\)) is equal to the product
of the two marginal probabilities, (\(N_AN_B/N^2\)), or else (assuming
that the events are all non-zero), that the conditional probability
(\(N_{A,B}/N_A\)) equals the marginal probability \(N_B/N\). Either way
this is represented by \(N\times N_{A,B} = N_AN_B\), and when this
holds, we can conclude that the events are independent.

After helping Charles \emph{neatly} fill in the contingency table, Sadie
begins to wonder about whether there are any shape-colour combinations
which are independent, or if any are mutually exclusive.

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Mutually exclusive events are codified via a \(0\) frequency. We can
  see then that \(\text{Cube}\) and \(\text{Red}\) are mutually
  exclusive. That is, if we know that an object is red, we also know
  that it is not a cube. And if we know that an object is a cube, then
  we know that it is not red.
\item
  Independence is more cumbersome to check. We require the product of
  marginal counts to be equal to the total times by the joint counts. As
  a result, the easiest way to check is to consider the product of each
  marginal value in the columns by each marginal value in the row,
  divided by \(50\). If this value corresponds to the value in that
  row/column pairing, then we know that those features are independent.
  Note that immediately we can rule out any products which are not
  divisible by \(50\), since we know that \(N_{A,B}\) is an integer for
  all \(A,B\) and \(N_{A,B} = N_AN_B/50\) if there is independence. To
  this end, we only need to check the product of each of the row totals
  with each of \(12\) and \(13\) (as those are the only two unique
  column totals). This gives, in order \(120\), \(130\), \(60\), \(65\),
  \(180\), \(195\), \(84\), \(91\), \(156\), and \(169\). None of these
  values are divisible by \(50\) and as a result we know that there is
  \textbf{no independence} codified in this table.

\subsubsection{Contingency Tables and Data Frames in
R}\label{contingency-tables-and-data-frames-in-r}

In R we can use the \texttt{table} and \texttt{prop.table} to calculate
the (interior) of a contingency table. This will return a \texttt{table}
type object in R, which can be thought of as a matrix of sorts. On it,
we can use the functions \texttt{rowSums} and \texttt{colSums} to get
the summation of the rows and columns, respectively. Typically the
object we pass to \texttt{table} will be a \textbf{data frame}. A data
frame is another R object type that we have not yet seen. The idea with
a data frame is that we have multiple columns with different variables
(of possibly different types) represented. Each row corresponds to a
single observation, and then each column is read as a feature of those
observations. Data frames are essentially large spreadsheets (or data
tables) which indicate the various observations that we have. In
practice, data frames are the most commonly used object in an R
analysis, and we will see them plenty going forward.

With a data frame specified, we can then use the \texttt{table} function
called on it to form a contingency table.

\DocumentationTok{\#\#   Yellow    5    3       4      1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then, to get the totals, we can either use \texttt{rowSums} or
\texttt{colSums} to return a vector with the corresponding row or column
sums.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally, we can take our formed contingency table, and use
\texttt{prop.table} on it, in order to return a table with the
proportions (rather than the frequencies).

Consider the following argument from Lewis Carroll, which proves
mathematically that no urn can have two balls of the same colour in it.

\begin{quote}
Suppose that there are balls which are either black, \(B\), or white,
\(W\), and two of unknown colours are contained in an urn with equal
likelihood. That is, \[P(BB)=P(BW)=P(WB)=P(WW)=\frac{1}{4}.\] Now,
consider adding a black ball to the urn so that
\[P(BBB)=P(BWB)=P(WBB)=P(WWB)=\frac{1}{4}.\] Consider then selecting a
ball at random. The chance that this ball is black is
\[P(B) = \frac{2}{3}.\] Thus, there is a \(2/3\) chance that the ball we
select is black, and as a result, there must be \(2\) black balls and
\(1\) white ball, and so we could not have had two black balls to start!

\chapter{Summarizing Statistical Experiments with Random
Variables}\label{summarizing-statistical-experiments-with-random-variables}

\section{The Need for Random
Variables}\label{the-need-for-random-variables}

When introducing probability originally we worked from a sample space
and then corresponding events. This is a very general framework which
allows us to effectively analyze any statistical experiment. Sample
spaces are not restricted to be numeric, for instance, and events are
simply subsets of the sample space. As a result, this framework provides
the tools for capturing uncertainty quantification in almost any
setting. Still, the need to enumerate sample spaces and events over
complex sets of arbitrary items is cumbersome and may prevent succinct
representations of the underlying phenomena. Often, rather than caring
about the entire space of outcomes from an experiment of interest, we
are primarily concerned we a summary of the experiment. When we can
summarize the experiment using a numerical quantity, we are able to
define a random variable.

\begin{definition}[Random
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-random-variable}{}\label{def-random-variable}

A random variable is a numeric quantity whose specific value depends on
chance through the outcome of a statistical experiment. Formally, a
random variable is a mapping from the result of an experiment to a set
of numbers.

\end{definition}

By reporting the numeric value of the random variable, we are able to
summarize the key part of the experiment, succinctly. For instance,
suppose that we are repeatedly tossing a coin. If we toss the coin
\(100\) times, then the sample space is going to consist of \(2^{100}\)
total possible outcomes, each of which is a sequence of \(100\) heads
and tails.\footnote{Recall our discussions of combinatorics.} Instead,
it may be more convenient to assign a random variable to be the number
of heads that show up on the \(100\) tosses of the coin. In this case,
the random variable takes on a non-negative integer between \(0\) and
\(100\). In many situations, such a summary may be all the is relevant
from the experiment.

It is important to recognize that information \emph{is} lost when we
define this random variable. If \(X\) summarizes the number of heads in
\(100\) tosses of a coin, then provided \(X\) you are not able to answer
the question ``what was the 23rd toss of the coin?'' As a result, random
variables smooth over the unnecessary information, summarizing the parts
of the statistical experiment that we care for. For any statistical
experiment, however, we need to carefully define the random variables
which are truly of interest to us. For instance, if the \(23\)rd toss of
the coin was integral to our decision-making, then perhaps we define a
random variable \(Y\) which counts the number of heads that show up on
the \(100\) tosses of the coin, but does so with negative numbers if the
\(23\)rd toss was a tail, and with positive numbers if it was a head.
Then, provided \(Y\) you can answer ``how many heads showed up in the
tosses of the coin? by calculating \(|Y|\), and you can answer''what was
the \(23\)rd toss of the coin?'' by looking at \(\text{sign}(Y)\).

\begin{example}[Random Variables at the Coffee
Shop]\protect\hypertarget{exm-random-var}{}\label{exm-random-var}

Back at their favourite coffee shop, Charles and Sadie are sitting in
their favourite chairs, discussing random variables and watching the
cash register for the inevitable sequence of customers who will arrive
there. Charles suggests playing a game together, which is creatively
called ``how many random variables can we name that have to do with the
statistical experiment of watching for customers at a cash register?''
Seeing as how catchy the name is, Sadie is excited to play along, and so
they start.

Name several distinct random variables which could be observed via the
described statistical experiment.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

There are essentially countless different random variables that could be
named here, depending on what is of interest. The important concept is
that each random variable needs to be a numeric quantity which is
calculable from the statistical experiment. For instance:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of people who arrive at the cashier in the next hour.
\item
  The length of time until the next customer arrives at the cashier.
\item
  The amount of money that the next customer spends when paying at the
  cashier.
\item
  A value of \(1\) if the next customer is wearing a hat, and a value of
  \(0\) otherwise.
\item
  The number of different items that are ordered by all customers over
  the next hour.
\item
  The number of words that the cashier says to the next customer, prior
  to payment.
\item
  A count of the number of red items of clothing that can be seen being
  worn by the next \(15\) customers.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Because of their ability to summarize effectively and flexibly the
pertinent components of a statistical experiment, random variables are
the default paradigm for discussing randomness. When discussing a random
variable we will typically use capital letters, such as \(X\), to
represent the random quantity with an unknown value. In the event that
an experiment is actually performed, and a value is realized for the
random variable, we will record this value as a lower case letter, such
as \(x\). For instance, the number of heads showing in \(100\) flips of
a coin is an unknown quantity depending on chance which we call \(X\).
Once we have flipped the coin \(100\) times and observed \(57\) heads,
we denote this as \(x=57\).

The importance of this notation is merely to emphasize what values are
unknown and random, and what values are known numeric quantities.
Because \(x\) is a known value taking on some set number we will not
often speak of probabilities involving \(x\).\footnote{We can actually
  discuss probabilities revolving around \(x\), but they are all deeply
  uninteresting. Every probability will either be \(1\), or \(0\). If I
  tell you that \(x = 5\), then \(P(x=5) = 1\) and \(P(x = 2) = 0\).
  While this is not a particularly \emph{interesting} probability
  statement, it is true, and somewhat surprisingly, can arise in
  meaningful ways.} Instead, we wish to translate the language of
probability that we have built to statements regarding the random
variable \(X\).

The random variable \(X\) has a corresponding ``sample space'' of
possible values that it can take on. We will typically refer to this as
the \emph{support} of the random variable, though borrowing other terms
from math courses (such as \emph{range}) will work also. This support,
which we can think of as directly analogous to the sample space of
arbitrary elements from before, will depend on the possible realizations
from the underlying experiment. We typically will denote the support of
a random variable \(X\) as \(\mathcal{X}\). After the experiment has
been performed the random variable will take on a single value from this
set.\footnote{The support of a random variable is directly analogous to
  the sample space from the statistical experiment. That is, it is the
  set of possible observations which can be made of the random variable.
  As a result, it is \emph{sometimes} permissible to call the support
  the ``sample space of the random variable'', in an informal manner.
  The informality here is important. Formally, a random variable \(X\)
  is a function which maps from the sample space to its support, which
  is to say \(X \colon \mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{X}\).} We can sometimes
compactly describe the set of possible values for a random variable, for
instance, by stating all of the integers, or integers between \(5\) and
\(10\), or even values less than \(1000\). This allows for compact
descriptions of \(\mathcal{X}\) even when the set \(\mathcal{S}\) is
challenging to describe. The probability of realizing any outcome in
\(\mathcal{X}\) is dictated by the underlying probability model.

When introducing the concepts of probability we indicated that
probability was assigned to events. With random variables, this remains
true. As a result we need to define events in terms of random variables.
When we have a random variable, \(X\), an event is defined as any set of
values that it can take on. For instance, we may have the event \(X=4\),
or the event \(X \geq 18\), or the event \(2 \leq X \leq 93\), or the
event \(X \in \{2,4,6,8,10\}\). In each case these are subsets of the
possible values that the random variable can take on, based on the
outcome of the experiment.\footnote{That is to say, events in the case
  of random variables are subsets of \(\mathcal{X}\).}

Just as before these events can be simple events (comprised of a single
outcome) or compound events (comprising of multiple outcomes). The event
\(\{X=5\}\) is a simple event, whereas the event \(\{X \geq 25\}\) is a
compound event. With events defined in this way, we can translate the
other concepts from the explicit event-based probability. Specifically,
we think of the experiment producing a numerical outcome, and then use
the same sets of tools as before applied to numeric events.

\begin{example}[Expanding on Random Variables at the Coffee
Shop]\protect\hypertarget{exm-rv-recap}{}\label{exm-rv-recap}

After tiring of their game of ``how many random variables can we name
that have to do with the statistical experiment of watching for
customers at a cash register?'', Charles and Sadie fall into a deeper
discussion of some of the some of their favourite random variables named
during the play through. They take turns describing the support of a
chosen random variable, as well as listing examples of simple and
compound events that can be translated into the language of random
variables.

Choose a random variable identified in Example~\ref{exm-random-var} and
indicate its support, as well as possible simple and compound events
that could be observed in terms of it.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Suppose that we take \(X\) to be a random variable representing ``The
number of people who arrive at the cashier in the next hour.'' The
support of this random variable is likely best select as the
non-negative integers. That is, we take
\[\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,\dots\}.\] There may be a
reasonable maximal value for the random quantity (such as knowing the
number of people who are within an hour radius of the coffee shop, or
else knowing the number of people who are presently alive), however, the
simpler ``all non-negative integers'' will likely suffice.

For simple events we may consider \(\{X = 0\}\) or \(\{X = 10\}\) or
\(\{X = 31415\}\). In every case, the simple event takes the form
\(\{X = x\}\).

For compound events we could consider \(\{X > 0\}\), representing the
event that at least one customer arises, we could consider
\(\{X \leq 10\}\), the event where no more than \(10\) customers show
up, or we could consider something a little more abstract, like
\(X \in \{0, 3, 5, 9, 19, 25\}\) or \(X\) is an even number. In all
these cases the key point is that compound events have more than one way
of being satisfied (in that they correspond to more than one event).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

When considering random variables there is a key distinction between two
types of random variables, discrete and continuous.

\begin{definition}[Discrete Random
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-discrete-random-variable}{}\label{def-discrete-random-variable}

A discrete random variable is any random variable whose support is
either finite or else countably infinite.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Continuous Random
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-continuous-random-variable}{}\label{def-continuous-random-variable}

A continuous random variable is any random variable whose support is
uncountably infinite.

\end{definition}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Countable and Uncountable Sets}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

We say that a set is \textbf{countable} whenever we can enumerate the
elements of the set using the positive integers. If we have a set with a
finite number of elements in it, then we say that it is countable
because each element in the set can get assigned an integer value (just
using \(1\) through to the cardinality of the set).

If we take a set like the positive integers, \(\{1,2,3,\dots\}\), then
this is an infinitely large set. However, it is still countable because
we can assign each element of the set an integer value (just use the
same integer it is corresponding to!). What if we have the set of
positive, even integers (\{2,4,6,8,\dots\})? Each of these is just \(2\)
times one of the counting numbers, in order, and so these too are
countable.

What if we took the set of real numbers\footnotemark{} in the interval
\([0,1]\)? In this case there is \textbf{no way} to map each of these
values to the values \(\{1,2,3,4,\dots\}\) and as a result the interval
\([0,1]\) is \textbf{not countable}. It is infinitely large, but it
remains infinitely large even after we have enumerated an infinite set
of the items in it.

A key difference between countable and uncountable sets is that, with a
countable set, we can\footnotemark{} sum over the elements of the set.
We cannot sum over the elements of an uncountable set, as there would be
no way to actually order and enumerate the items. In this course the
detailed mathematics of countable versus non-countable sets is
tangential to the main point which is in distinguishing between discrete
and continuous random variables.

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Recall that ``real numbers'' are just all of the standard
numbers that we think of (decimals, whole numbers, fractions, negative
values, etc.).}

\footnotetext{(in principle)}

Typically, discrete random variables will take on some collection of the
integers, where continuous random variables will be defined on some
interval (or set of intervals). That is, we may take discrete random
variables to be defined on \(\{0,1,2,3,\dots,100\}\) or
\(\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}\) or \(\mathbb{Z}\)\footnote{This notation refers to
  the set of all integers}. For continuous random variables we may take
\(X \in [0,1]\) or \(X \in (0,\infty)\) or \(X\in (-\infty,129]\).

\begin{example}[The Countability of Coffee Shop Random
Variables]\protect\hypertarget{exm-discrete-vs-continuous-rv}{}\label{exm-discrete-vs-continuous-rv}

Charles and Sadie have been discussing the features of all of the random
variables they identified at the coffee shop for a long time when Sadie
points out that they have not been differentiating between discrete and
continuous random variables. Charles thinks ``how could we have
overlooked this?'' and seeks to remedy the situation, immediately!

List at least one discrete and one continuous random variable that could
arise via the statistical experiment of watching the cashier at a coffee
shop over time (as described in Example~\ref{exm-random-var}).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

For this we categorize the random variables originally defined in the
solution to Example~\ref{exm-random-var}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``The number of people who arrive at the cashier in the next hour.''

  ``The number of different items that are ordered by all customers over
  the next hour.''

  ``The number of words that the cashier says to the next customer,
  prior to payment.''

  ``A count of the number of red items of clothing that can be seen
  being worn by the next \(15\) customers.''

  These are all \textbf{discrete} random variables, as the only values
  they can take on are the counting integer values.
\item
  ``The length of time until the next customer arrives at the cashier.''
  This is a \textbf{continuous} random variable, as it can take on any
  value over an interval (say, the interval \((0,28800)\) if the store
  is open for \(8\) hours and the customer were there the whole time).
\item
  ``The amount of money that the next customer spends when paying at the
  cashier.'' This is a \textbf{discrete} random variable, as it must
  take a finite set of values. One way to make this clear is to count
  the value in cents, and then it will be only integer values.
\item
  ``A value of \(1\) if the next customer is wearing a hat, and a value
  of \(0\) otherwise.'' This is a \textbf{discrete} random variable as
  it can only be from \(\{0,1\}\).
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Probability Distributions and Probability Mass
Functions}\label{probability-distributions-and-probability-mass-functions}

We will discuss continuous random variables later. For now, we turn our
focus to discrete random variables. One of the major utilities of random
variables is that they provide a shorthand for summarizing the results
of a statistical experiment. To this end, there are several tools which
have been developed centered on random variables which help to expedite
the analysis of the corresponding probabilities. Chief among these tools
is the concept of a probability distribution.

\begin{definition}[Probability
Distribution]\protect\hypertarget{def-probability-distribution}{}\label{def-probability-distribution}

A probability distribution is a mathematical statement describing the
probabilistic behaviour of a random variable.

\end{definition}

Distributions capture the underlying random behaviour of the random
variables of interest, and in so doing, summarize information regarding
the experiment or process that is being considered. When concerned with
discrete random variables, we typically summarize probability
distributions through the use of a probability mass function.

\begin{definition}[Probability Mass
Function]\protect\hypertarget{def-probability-mass-function}{}\label{def-probability-mass-function}

A probability mass function is a function, \(p(x)\), which maps possible
values for a discrete random variable (the set \(\mathcal{X}\)) to the
probabilities corresponding to those events.\footnote{That is, \(p(x)\)
  is a function, \(p\colon\mathcal{X}\to[0,1]\).}

\end{definition}

If a random variable \(X\) has support
\(\mathcal{X} = \{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k\}\), then a probability mass
function is a function \(p(x)\) such that \(p(x_1) = P(X = x_1)\),
\(p(x_2) = P(X = x_2)\), and so on through to \(p(x_k) = P(X=x_k)\).
Once a probability mass function is known, all of the probabilistic
behaviour of the random variable is fully described.

\begin{example}[The Coin Game for
Three]\protect\hypertarget{exm-probability-mass-function}{}\label{exm-probability-mass-function}

Sometimes Charlie and Sadie are joined by their friend Garth on their
trips to the coffee shop. Also a probability aficionado, Garth contently
joins in the game with Charles and Sadie where three coins are flipped,
and depending on the results, one friend pays for the group. Garth's
order is typically less than Charles and Sadie and so Sadie proposes the
following modified game.

\begin{quote}
A fair coin is tossed three times. If all tosses of the coin show the
same symbol, Garth pays. Otherwise, if there are more heads than tails,
Charles pays. Finally, if there are more tails than heads, Sadie pays.
\end{quote}

Help to simplify this statistical experiment by first defining a random
variable, \(X\) which can be used to encode this game and then record
the probability mass function of \(X\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

One choice of \(X\) is to allow \(X\) to be the number of heads that
show on three tosses of the coin. In this case we have
\(\mathcal{X} = \{0,1,2,3\}\). If \(x = 0\) or \(x = 3\) is observed
then Garth pays. If \(x = 2\) is observed then Charles pays. Finally, if
\(x = 1\) is observed, Sadie pays. Thus writing down the probability
mass function for \(X\) also provides an easy way for computing the
probability of each player having to pay.

In order for \(X = 0\), we must have all tails come up. There are
\(2^3 = 8\) total possible sequences of \(3\) coin tosses, and only
\(1\) of these results in \(X = 0\), therefore
\(P(X = 0) = p(0) = \frac{1}{8}\). The same logic applies to \(X = 3\)
where we need to toss all heads. There are several techniques for
finding \(p(1)\) and \(p(2)\).\footnotemark{} The most direct way is to
recognize that there are exactly \(3\) ways of observing \(1\) head (it
can be in the first, second, or third toss). Thus,
\(p(1) = \frac{3}{8}\). For \(p(2)\), the same logic applies except we
ask ``where is the one tail?'' to give \(p(2) = \frac{3}{8}\). Then,
taken together, this results in \[p(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{8} & x \in \{0, 3\} \\
\frac{3}{8} & x \in \{1, 2\} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\] We can also read off from this result
that Garth pays \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the time in the long run, while Sadie
and Charles each pay \(\frac{3}{8}\) of the time.\footnotemark{}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{One particularly elegant technique is to realize that
\(p(1)\) and \(p(2)\) must be the same by interchanging the roles of
heads and tails. Thus, we have \(p(1) + p(2) + 0.25 = 1\) by the unitary
property of probability, and rearranging gives \(p(1) = p(2) = 0.375\).}

\footnotetext{We can actually write down this probability mass function
more succinctly as \(p(x) = \binom{3}{x}\frac{1}{8}\). You can check
this holds for yourself, and we will understand why later on!}

\end{example}

The previously outlined conditions for probabilities must still hold
when using probability mass functions. As a result, we know that
probabilities are all between \(0\) and \(1\), and so we must have
\(0 \leq p(x) \leq 1\), for all \(x\in\mathcal{X}\). Moreover, we saw
previously that summing the probabilities over the full sample space
gave a value of \(1\). Correspondingly, we must have that
\[\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x) = 1.\] These two properties are often used
to define a \emph{valid} probability mass function, and we can use these
properties to both check whether a given mass function is valid and to
turn a given function into a valid probability mass function.

\begin{example}[Charles's Messy Writing Strikes
Again]\protect\hypertarget{exm-finding-a-pmf}{}\label{exm-finding-a-pmf}

Charles is reading through some notes regarding a new game under
development which, like most good games, relies at least a little bit on
chance. In the notes there is a probability mass function written down,
which, the best Charles can make out, reads
\[p(x) = \begin{cases} 3c & x = 0 \\ 0.6 & x = 1 \\ 7c & x = 2.\end{cases}\]
Frustrated with the illegibility, Charles brings the problem to Sadie
who points out, if it really is \(p(0) = 3c\) and \(p(2) = 7c\), they
actually have all the information required to solve the problem.

What is the probability mass function, assuming Charles is reading it
correctly.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We know that two properties must be true of all probability mass
functions. First \(0 \leq p(x) \leq 1\). Second,
\(\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x) = 1\). The first property tells us that
\(0 < 3c < 1\) and that \(0 < 7c < 1\). This means that \(c > 0\), and
that \(c < 1/3\) and \(c < 1/7\). Using the second property we get that
\[1 = 3c + 0.6 + 7c \implies 0.4 = 10c.\] This tells us that
\(c = 0.04\), which satisfies all of the previous properties. Taking
\(c = 0.04\) gives a probability mass function of
\[p(x) = \begin{cases} 0.12 & x = 0 \\ 0.6 & x = 1 \\ 0.28 & x = 2.\end{cases}\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

When solving questions related to probabilities using a probability mass
function, the same secondary properties apply. Notably, if we want to
know \(P(X\in A)\), for some set of possible values \(A\), then we can
write \[P(X\in A) = \sum_{x\in A}p(x).\] This can be particularly
helpful, for instance, if we want to know \(P(X \leq c)\) for some
constant value \(c\). In this case we know that the possible values
range from teh smallest value \(X\) can take on, through to \(c\),
giving for instance, \[P(X\leq c) = \sum_{x=0}^c p(x),\] if
\(X \geq 0\). Rules regarding the complements of events continue to hold
as well, where for instance, \(P(X > c) = 1 - P(X\leq c)\), giving a
useful avenue for simplifying probability calculations.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie: Amateur
Ornithologists]\protect\hypertarget{exm-probability-calc}{}\label{exm-probability-calc}

Charles and Sadie watched a documentary about birds together, which had
Sadie become quite interested in bird watching. Charles is
skeptical\footnote{Charles is still not entirely sure if birds are even
  real, let alone worth watching.} but agrees to go along with Sadie,
supposing that there is a high enough probability of something
interesting happening. Sadie scours the scholarly literature and
determines that, in the area, the probability of seeing \(x\) rare birds
over a five hour birding session has a probability mass function given
by \[p(x) = \frac{e^{-3}3^x}{x!},\] where \(x\geq 0\).\footnote{How
  Sadie found such a concrete answer, I will never know.}

What is the probability that during their bird watching adventure,
Charles and Sadie see at least \(1\) rare bird?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We are interesting in the probability \(P(X \geq 1)\), which we can
write down explicitly as
\[P(X \geq 1) = \sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{e^{-3}3^x}{x!}.\] While,
strictly speaking, it is possible to solve this infinite summation, it
is an infinite summation and we would rather not. Instead we can realize
that, if we take the event \(A = \{X \geq 1\}\) then \(A^C\) is the
event \(\{X < 1\} = \{X = 0\}\). As a result, using our elementary rules
of probability we get that
\[P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - \frac{e^{-3}3^{0}}{0!} = 1 - e^{-3} \approx 0.95.\]
As a result, there is an approximately \(0.95\) probability that they
see a rare bird while bird watching for five hours.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

With events defined in terms of random variables, we can talk about
events as being independent of each other or mutually exclusive using
the familiar definitions. On a related note, we can talk of joint and
conditional probabilities, relating to multiple events. With joint
probabilities, it is often easiest to combine the event into a single,
compound event, and find the marginal probability of that event. For
instance, if you have the events \(X\) is even and \(X \leq 15\), then
the intersection of these events is \(X \in \{2,4,6,8,10,12,14\}\)
(supposing \(X > 0\)).

\begin{example}[Charles: The Ornithological
Photographer]\protect\hypertarget{exm-condition-joint-probability}{}\label{exm-condition-joint-probability}

After a single time bird watching Charles is hooked! The next time that
they go out, Charles brings a camera to snag some beautiful memories of
the majesty they are witnessing. The only trouble is that Charles is not
particularly good at taking photographs of stills, let alone of
creatures that can fly. Charles is not yet certain, but suspects that
every time a photograph is snapped, there is a \(0.1\) probability that
it turns out good. Because the camera is a film camera, the number of
photos taken is a key metric, and Charles works out that, if \(X\) is
the number of bad photographs taken for every good photograph, the
probability mass function for \(X\) is given by
\[p(x) = (0.1)\times (0.9)^{x},\] where \(x \geq 0\) is an integer.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Suppose that Charles has taken \(2\) photos, both of which are bad.

  before a good one?
\item
  What is the probability that at least \(2\) bad photos are taken?

  one another.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Here, we want \(p(3) = (0.1)\times(0.9)^3 = 0.0729\).
\item
  Considering \(A \cap B\) we have
  \(\{X = 3\} \cap \{X \geq 4\} = \emptyset\). As a result,
  \(P(A,B) = 0\) since there is no overlap between \(A\) and \(B\). As a
  result, these events are mutually exclusive.
\item
  Here, we can frame this probability as \[P(X \geq 4 | X \geq 2)\] This
  can be directly computed using the definition of conditional
  probability, \begin{align*}
   P(X \geq 4 | X \geq 2) &= \frac{P(X \geq 4, X \geq 2)}{P(X \geq 2)} \\
   &= \frac{P(X \geq 4)}{1 - P(X < 2)} \\
   &= \frac{1 - P(X < 4)}{1 - (0.1 + 0.1\times0.9)} \\
   &= \frac{1 - (0.1 + 0.1\times 0.9 + 0.1\times 0.9^2 + 0.1\times0.9^3)}{1 - (0.1 + 0.1\times 0.9)} \\
   &= 0.81.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Through direct calculation we get
  \[P(X \geq 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - (0.1 + 0.1\times 0.9) = 0.81.\]
\item
  Combining (c) and (d) we find that the probability that an additional
  two photos are required, given that two have already been taken, is
  the same as the probability that two photos are required, without
  knowing that any have been taken. While this feels like an
  independence type of property, it is not precisely independence. Note
  that the event \(\{X \geq 4\}\) immediately gives the event
  \(\{X \geq 2\}\) and so they cannot be independent of one
  another.\footnotemark{} For this to be independent we would require
  \(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\) which is not true of any of the events
  discussed.
\item
  One option is to consider the event \(X \geq 0\) with any other event.
  Because \(\{X \geq 0\} = \mathcal{X}\), no information can be gained
  conditioning on this event.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Instead of independence, we may describe this distribution
as being ``memoryless''. If you know that you have been waiting a
certain amount of time for something to happen (a good picture to get
taken) that does not change your belief about how much longer you have
to wait; the process ``forgets'' that it has been ongoing for sometime.}

\end{example}

\section{Multiple Random Variables and Joint Probability Mass
Functions}\label{multiple-random-variables-and-joint-probability-mass-functions}

While we can discuss independence, joint probabilities, and conditional
probabilities relating to events on the same random variable, it is
often of interest to combine multiple random variables. Sometimes these
random variables will be multiple versions coming from the same
distribution, and other times they will be coming from multiple
different distributions. In either event, frequently our main concern is
in summarizing the probabilistic behaviour of two or more random
quantities.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={A Discussion of Distributional Language}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Note that when we talk of a random variable ``following'' a particular
distribution, we are saying that the probability mass function of the
random variable is described by that distribution's mass function. Thus,
if two random variables ``share a distribution'', we just mean that
their probabilistic behaviour is described by the same underlying mass
function.

For instance, if I flip a coin \(10\) times, and you flip a different
coin \(10\) times, and we each count the number of heads that show up,
we can say that the random quantity for the number of heads I observe
will have the \textbf{same distribution} as the random quantity for the
number of heads that you observe.

These two quantities are not equal, in general, but they are described
by the same random processes.

\end{tcolorbox}

When we describe the distribution of a particular random variable, we
are implicitly describing the marginal probabilities associated with
that quantity. Just as before, the marginal probabilities describe the
behaviour of the random variable alone. What happens when we want to be
able to describe multiple components of an experiment, together? For
this we require extending the idea of a joint probability beyond the
concept of events.

Suppose that we roll two six-sided fair dice. Let \(X\) denote the sum
of the two dice, and let \(Y\) denote the maximum value showing on the
two dice. \(X\) is a discrete random variable taking on values between
\(2\) and \(12\), while \(Y\) is a discrete random variable taking on
values between \(1\) and \(6\). The supports for the two random
variables are different from one another and so immediately we know that
their probabilistic behaviour must be different, despite the fact that
both random variables summarize the same statistical experiment.

We can also immediately see that the two random variables, while not
equal to each other, are dependent. For instance, if you know that
\(Y=1\) then you know that \(X = 2\), and if you know that \(Y = 3\),
then you know that \(X \leq 6\). To begin to capture the joint behaviour
of \(X\) and \(Y\) we introduce the joint distribution and joint
probability mass function.

\begin{definition}[Joint
Distribution]\protect\hypertarget{def-joint-distribution}{}\label{def-joint-distribution}

A joint probability distribution describes the joint probabilistic
behaviour of two or more random variables, simultaneously.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Joint Probability Mass
Function]\protect\hypertarget{def-joint-pmf}{}\label{def-joint-pmf}

A joint probability mass function describes the behaviour of the joint
distribution of multiple random variables. For a set of random
variables, \(X_1, \dots, X_n\), the joint probability mass function
assigns a probability value for every \emph{tuple} of values that
\((X_1,\dots,X_n)\) can take on.

\end{definition}

The joint probability mass function is analogous to the marginal
probability mass function, only it considers joint events rather than
marginal ones. Suppose that you have two random variables, \(X\) and
\(Y\). The joint probability mass function assigns a probability value
for every pair of values that \((X,Y)\) can take on. That is,
\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)\). Then, once you know the joint
behaviour of \(X\) and \(Y\), you can fully summarize the combined
behaviour of the underlying experiment.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie's Bird
Outings]\protect\hypertarget{exm-joint-pmf}{}\label{exm-joint-pmf}

Charles and Sadie have both gotten deeply into their ornithological
adventures. They go on trips together, Sadie is responsible for spotting
the rare birds, and then Charles for snapping the photos. Charles has
settled on a camera setup that allows for \(10\) pictures to be taken
before changing the film. The strategy that they follow is to go out and
look for a rare bird. When one is spotted, Charles takes \(10\) photos,
trying to get as many good photos as possible. Then, the film is
replaced and they repeat the process.

If \(X\) is a random variable representing the number of good photos
that are taken, and \(Y\) is the number of birds that are seen on the
trip, then the joint probability mass function of \(X\) and \(Y\) is
\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\]
with \(0 \leq x \leq 10y\), and \(y \geq 0\).

\item
  What is the probability that one bird is seen and there are no good
  photos taken?
\item
  What is the probability that there is one or fewer good photos taken

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Here we want \(Y = 1\) and \(X = 0\). Thus, we compute

\item
  Here we want \(\{X \leq 1\}\) and \(Y = 2\). This is the same as
  \(X = 0\) with \(Y = 2\) or \(X = 1\) with \(Y = 2\). Thus,
  \begin{align*}
  p_{X,Y}(0,2) + p_{X,Y}(1,2) &= \binom{10(2)}{0}\times(0.25)^{0}\times(0.75)^{10(2) - 0}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^2}{2!} \\
  &\quad + \binom{10(2)}{1}\times(0.25)^{1}\times(0.75)^{10(2) - 1}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^2}{2!} \\
  &\approx 0.00547.\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Joint Probability Distributions as Contingency
Tables}\label{joint-probability-distributions-as-contingency-tables}

In practice, joint probability mass functions can be thought of as
analogous to the contingency tables we previously saw. If the first
variable represents the first random variable being considered, and the
second variable represents the second random variable, then each cell of
the contingency table assigns a probability to one of the joint events
that could be observed in the experiment. Joint distributions are a
useful generalization of contingency tables as they allow us to
compactly represent not only two different random variables, but
sometimes many more. All of the definitions used for the case of two
random variables extend naturally to three, four, and beyond.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie: Rock-Paper-Scissors
Experimentation]\protect\hypertarget{exm-contingency-table-as-joint-pmf}{}\label{exm-contingency-table-as-joint-pmf}

Charles and Sadie were once asked if rock-paper-scissors may be an
easier way to solve their ``who pays for coffee'' dilemmas. Though both
of them rejected the description of their coffee games as a ``dilemma'',
they had never really given it much thought. One day while bird
watching, during a particularly long break with no birds, they begin to
think through whether this could work or not. To this end, the friends
play \(1000\) games, recording the results of each game into a
contingency table. They suspect that this provides the true long run
proportion of occurrences. To encode these games numerically, they take
\(X = -1\), \(X=0\), and \(X=1\) to represent Charles playing rock,
paper, and scissors respectively, and they take \(Y = -1\), \(Y=0\), and
\(Y=1\) to represent the same events from Sadie.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
& \(Y=-1\) & \(Y = 0\) & \(Y = 1\) \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\(X=-1\) & 400 & 100 & 50 \\
\(X=0\) & 10 & 200 & 40 \\
\(X=1\) & 50 & 50 & 100 \\
\end{longtable}

What is the joint probability mass function that corresponds to this
contingency table?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We can explicitly enumerate the possibilities to define the joint
probability mass function. That is \[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \begin{cases}
0.4 & x = -1, y = -1 \\
0.1 & x = -1, y = 0 \\
0.05 & x = -1, y = 1 \\
0.01 & x = 0, y = -1 \\
0.2 & x = 0, y = 0 \\
0.04 & x = 0, y = 1 \\
0.05 & x = 1, y = -1 \\
0.05 & x = 1, y = 0 \\
0.1 & x = 1, y = 1.
\end{cases}\] While it may be possible to express this in a more compact
way, this fits the criteria for a joint probability mass function.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Independence of Random
Variables}\label{independence-of-random-variables}

If we continue to consider the case of a bivariate (two variable) joint
distribution, we can use this setting to introduce the independence of
random variables. Recall that the joint probability mass function of
\(X\) and \(Y\) is a function, \(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)\). We
have also introduced the marginal mass functions, \(p_X(x) = P(X = x)\)
and \(p_Y(y) = P(Y = y)\). Further, we have said that two events, \(A\)
and \(B\), are independent if their joint probability is equal to the
product of their marginal probabilities, that is \(P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\).

If we take \(A=\{X=x'\}\) and \(B=\{Y=y'\}\), then if \(A\perp B\) we
can write \(p_{X,Y}(x',y')=p_X(x')p_Y(y')\). If this holds for every
possible \(x'\) and every possible \(y'\), then we say that \(X\) and
\(Y\) are independent random variables, and we write \(X \perp Y\).

\begin{definition}[Independent Random
Variables]\protect\hypertarget{def-independent-rv}{}\label{def-independent-rv}

Two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be independent random
variables if their joint probability mass function is given by the
product of their marginal probability mass functions,
\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x)p_Y(y).\] We write \(X\perp Y\), and read: \(X\)
is independent of \(Y\).

\end{definition}

In words, two random variables are independent whenever all possible
combinations of events between them are independent.

\begin{example}[Charles the Sports
Fan]\protect\hypertarget{exm-pmf-independence}{}\label{exm-pmf-independence}

Charles is a major sports fan and has been particularly fond of
\emph{hurling} ever since a trip to Ireland. Each week, Charles watches
with deep investment, becoming very attached to the outcome. Because of
this attachment, Charles is willing to do just about anything to help
out from behind the television set, which mostly consists of wearing the
right coloured clothing. Charles's theory is that by increasing the
number of articles of green clothing that are worn, the number of scores
in the game will also increase.

Let \(X\) represent the number of articles of green clothing that
Charles is wearing, with \(X \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}\), and \(Y\) is the
number of scores in the game. Suppose that
\[p_X(x) = \frac{(x-2)^2}{10},\] and that
\[p_Y(y) = \frac{e^{-45}\times 45^y}{y!}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the joint probability mass function for \(X\) and \(Y\),
  assuming that they are independent?
\item
  If it is determined that, assuming Charles wears no green clothing,
  the probability of \(50\) scores is \(0.01\), are these random
  variables independent?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  If \(X\perp Y\), then the joint probability mass function is the
  product of the two, which is to say
  \[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{(x-2)^2}{10}\cdot\frac{e^{-45}\times 45^y}{y!} = \frac{e^{-45}}{10}\times (x-2)^2 \times \frac{45^y}{y!}.\]
\item
  Using the joint probability mass function found in (a),
  \[p_{X,Y}(0, 15) = \frac{e^{-45}}{10}\times (0-2)^2 \times \frac{45^{50}}{(50)!} \approx 0.017.\]
  This is not equal to \(0.01\), and so it must be the case that
  \(X\not\perp Y\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[The Independence
Argument]\protect\hypertarget{exm-independence-arg}{}\label{exm-independence-arg}

Charles and Sadie are having a disagreement about the nature of the
probabilities on their bird outings. Charles claims that, without
knowing the marginal probability mass functions of the number of good
pictures taken, and the number of rare birds that are seen, there is no
way to tell whether the the two random quantities are independent or
not. Sadie cannot say exactly why this argument feels wrong, but insists
that the two quantities must not be independent.

Who is correct, and why? Recall that
\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\]
with \(0 \leq x \leq 10y\), and \(y \geq 0\)

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

In this case Sadie is correct. The most clear way of seeing this is by
noting that the support set for \(X\) depends on \(Y\). The question to
ask yourself is: how could two functions which are independent of one
another multiply together so that one's support depends on the other's?
It cannot happen. Put differently: we know that these cannot be
independent as, if \(Y=0\) then \(P(X=0)=1\) as Charles will not take
any pictures.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Equivalent Definition of Independence}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

There is an equivalence between the described definition, and a slightly
more intuitive definition for independence.

Whenever \(X\perp Y\) any two events corresponding to \(X\) and \(Y\),
say \(X \in A\) and \(Y \in B\) are independent. The subtle distinction
is that in our previous definition, we were only concerned with simple
events of the form \(X=x'\) or \(Y=y'\). Here we allow any two arbitrary
events.

Note that if we have the above definition holding for simple events,
then \begin{align*}
P(X \in A, Y \in B) &= \sum_{x\in A}P(X=x,Y\in B) \\
&= \sum_{x\in A}\sum_{y \in B} P(X=x,Y=y)\\
&= \sum_{x\in A}\sum_{y \in B} p_X(x)p_Y(y) \\
&= \left(\sum_{x\in A}p_X(x)\right)\left(\sum_{y\in B}p_Y(y)\right)\\
&= P(X\in A)P(Y\in B).
\end{align*}

Even by only making the assumption for simple events, the conclusion
regarding compound events follows naturally. Whenever any two random
variables are known to be independent we know that any two events
corresponding to these random variables will be independent. Moreover,
we can directly write down the joint probability mass function by taking
the product of the two marginals.

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Conditional Probability
Distributions}\label{conditional-probability-distributions}

When introducing events, we discussed how the concepts of independence
and dependence could be understood more intuitively through the use of
conditional probabilities. The same is true for random variables.

\begin{definition}[Conditional
Distributions]\protect\hypertarget{def-conditional-distribution}{}\label{def-conditional-distribution}

A conditional distribution of a random variable captures the
probabilistic behaviour of a random variable, given information
regarding another (or several other) random variables.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Conditional Probability Mass
Function]\protect\hypertarget{def-conditional-pmf}{}\label{def-conditional-pmf}

A conditional probability mass function assigns probability values
associated with any conditional event between multiple random variables.
For instance, if there are two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), the
conditional probability mass function of \(X\) given \(Y\) characterizes
events of the form \(X\) given \(Y=y\). Mathematically, the conditional
mass function is \[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}.\]

\end{definition}

This definition is analogous to the formula for conditional
probabilities more generally, give by the joint distribution over the
marginal distribution. To determine the probability of any event (for
\(X\)) given some information about \(Y\), you plug-in \(X=x\) and
\(Y=y\) into the conditional probability mass function. If you want to
condition on more than one random variable, the quantities extend in
exactly the same way, where for instance
\[P(X=x|Y=y,Z=z)=\frac{P(X=x,Y=y,z=z)}{P(Y=y,Z=z)}.\]

\begin{example}[Charles Accepts the
Argument]\protect\hypertarget{exm-conditional-pmf}{}\label{exm-conditional-pmf}

After some convincing, Charles accepts the argument that the number of
good pictures taken and the number of rare birds seen cannot be
independent events. What really makes this clear, however, is when Sadie
points out that the marginal probability mass function for the number of
rare birds seen is given by \[p_{Y} = \frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\] Taken
together with the fact that
\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\]
with \(0 \leq x \leq 10y\), and \(y \geq 0\), Charles realizes that the
conditional distribution of \(X|Y\) can be computed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the conditional probability mass function of \(X\) given
  \(Y\)?
\item
  Given that \(2\) birds are seen, what is the probability that any good
  photos are taken?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  For the conditional probability mass function we take
  \(p_{X,Y}(x, y)/p_{Y}(y)\)\$. This gives
  \[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{\binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}}{\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}} = \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}.\]
\item
  To represent this, we want \(P(X \geq 1 | Y = 2)\). From properties of
  probability, we know that
  \(P(X \geq 1 | Y = 2) = 1 - P(X < 1 | Y = 2) = P(X = 0 | Y = 2)\), and
  so using the conditional probability mass function found previously,
  this gives
  \[P(X = 0 | Y = 2) = \binom{20}{0}(0.25)^{0}\times(0.75)^{20} = 0.75^{20}.\]
  As a result, the probability of interest is
  \(1-0.75^{20} \approx 0.9968\), which is the probability that Charles
  takes at least one good picture if two birds are seen.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

As was discussed, the joint probability mass function of two independent
random variables is given by the product of the marginals. If
\(X\perp Y\), then \(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X}(x)p_{Y}(y)\). Combined with
the expression for the conditional probability mass function this
results in \(p_{X|Y}(x|y) = p_X(x)\). That is, whenever two variables
are independent, the conditional probability mass function is exactly
equal to the marginal probability mass function.

We saw that this was true for events, and the same reasoning applies
here. This result gives an intuitive method for interpreting the
independence of random variables. Two random variables are independent
whenever any information about the one does not provide information
about the other; when they are completely uninformative for one another.
With this intuitive description it is easier to infer when independence
of random variables is reasonable. Doing so is a useful skill for
manipulating probability expressions.

\begin{example}[Charles Exploration of
Independence]\protect\hypertarget{exm-independence-via-pmfs}{}\label{exm-independence-via-pmfs}

A little shaken after the previous independence mishap, Charles is
committed to better understanding independence at an intuitive level. As
a result, every time a pair of random quantities are seen together
Charles has taken to deciding whether or not the underlying random
variables would be independent.

For each of the following, indicate whether the pairs of random
quantities are likely to be independent (and why).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles is buying a butternut squash, and is considering the length of
  the squash (\(X\)) and the weight of the squash (\(Y\)) as the most
  relevant measurements.
\item
  Charles is sitting at an intersection which has a separated bike path
  in front of it, and a lane of vehicular traffic. Take \(X\) to be the
  number of bikes passing by over a length of time, and \(Y\) to be the
  number of cars passing by over a certain time.
\item
  As the weekend comes around Charles prepares for the hurling match,
  once again considering whether the number of green items of clothing
  worn (\(X\)) has an impact on the number of scores (\(Y\)).
\item
  Charles and Sadie are playing battle dice, where Charles rolls a die
  and compares the result (\(X\)) to the result of a separate die rolled
  by Sadie (\(Y\)).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The length of a butternut squash and its weight are likely dependent.
  The longer a squash is, all else equal, the more likely it will be
  heavier, and vice versa. Both of these measure the size of the squash,
  and as a result, will be connected.
\item
  This is an interesting example which likely could be argued either
  way. On one hand, if cars and bikes do not mix, then the traffic of
  one will not likely impact the traffic on another. However, there are
  plenty of reasons why a larger number of bikes may suggest a certain
  number of cars: (1) perhaps more people bike on the weekends and fewer
  people drive on the weekends; (2) perhaps a city with more bikers has
  more cars; (3) perhaps more bikes represents a busy time of the day,
  which would also lead to more cars. It is challenging to know
  precisely where the impact stems from, it seems likely that there
  would be some relationship.
\item
  There is likely no impact of what Charles is doing and what is
  happening in a sporting match being watched on the TV. As a result,
  these two quantities should be independent.
\item
  The die roll from Charles has no impact on the die roll from Sadie,
  and vice versa. As a result, these two random variables will almost
  certainly be independent.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Manipulating Probabilities with Random
Variables}\label{manipulating-probabilities-with-random-variables}

Seeing as the joint, marginal, and conditional probability mass
functions are exactly analogous to the corresponding concepts when they
were introduced regarding events, it is reasonable to assume that we can
extend the multiplication rule, the law of total probability, and Bayes'
theorem to the framework of probability functions. Indeed, each of these
relationships continues to hold for random variables in much the way
that would be expected.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Multiplication Rule (with Probability Mass Functions)}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Translating the multiplication rule to use probability mass functions
gives \[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y) = p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_X(x).\] This
can be seen by rearranging the relationship defining the conditional
probabilities.

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Bayes' Theorem (with Probability Mass Functions)}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Bayes' Theorem can be rewritten using probability mass functions as
well. Specifically,
\[p_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y)}{p_X(x)}.\] This follows
directly from the definition of conditional probabilities, as well as
the multiplication rule.

\end{tcolorbox}

These rules give the ability to compute the joint distribution and the
other conditional information, when we have information regarding some
of the marginals and some of the conditionals. These properties are used
less \emph{explicitly} when dealing with probability mass functions
directly. Instead, they almost become absorbed into the fabric of the
defining relationships themselves. That is to say, you are less likely
to see Bayes' theorem invoked directly when moving between conditional
distributions; however, moving between conditional distributions
\emph{is} an important skill, and requires the use of Bayes' Theorem.

\begin{example}[Charles and the
Chores]\protect\hypertarget{exm-pmg-multiplication-and-bayes}{}\label{exm-pmg-multiplication-and-bayes}

Charles has decided to take a break from having paid employment, instead
taking time to help ensure that Sadie's house runs smoothly as Sadie has
been busy trying to write a novel. Unfortunately, sometimes chores are
not done in a timely manner, despite Charles's best efforts. While Sadie
has been nothing but supportive, Charles decides to turn to probability
to ease uncertainties.

Define \(X=1\) if a given chore was done by Charles, with \(X=0\) if it
was done by Sadie. Let \(Y=1\) denote a chore being done on time with
\(Y = 0\) if it was late. Suppose that \begin{align*}
p_{Y|X}(y|x) &= (0.5 + 0.4x)^{y}\times(0.5 - 0.4x)^{1-y},\\
p_X(x) &= 0.85^{x}\times(0.15)^{1-x},\\

  \[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_{X}(x) = (0.5 + 0.4x)^{y}\times(0.5 - 0.4x)^{1-y}\times0.85^{x}\times(0.15)^{1-x}.\]
  Then, to find the probability that a chore is late and done by Charles
  we take \(p_{X,Y}(1,0) = 0.1\times 0.85 = 0.085.\)
\item
  For Charles, we want \(P(Y=0|X=1)\), which can be solved for directly
  using the provided conditional probability mass function. That is,
  \[p_{Y|X}(0|1) = (0.5 + 0.4)^{0}\times(0.5 - 0.4)^{1} = 0.1.\] For
  Sadie, we want \(P(Y=0|X=0)\). This gives
  \[p_{Y|X}(0|0) = (0.5)^{0}\times(0.5)^{1} = 0.5.\]
\item
  Here we require the alternative conditional distribution, \(P(X|Y)\).
  For this we can leverage Bayes' Theorem. Specifically,
  \[p_{X|Y} = \frac{p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_{X}(x)}{p_{Y}(y)} = \frac{(0.5 + 0.4x)^{y}\times(0.5 - 0.4x)^{1-y}\times0.85^{x}\times(0.15)^{1-x}}{.85\times(0.9)^y(0.1)^{1-y} + 0.075}.\]
  Then, the probability that Charles did the chore, given it was late,
  is \(p_{X|Y}(1|0) = 0.53125\) and the probability that Sadie did the
  chore, given it was late, is \(p_{X|Y}(0|0) = 0.46875\).
\item
  Two things are true with the given probabilities. First, if a chore
  was done late, it was more likely done by Charles than Sadie. Second,
  Sadie is more likely to do chores late than Charles. This explains why
  Charles may feel responsibility for the late chores: a higher
  proportion of late chores are Charles's chores. However, that is only
  because Charles does so many more chores to begin (the probability
  that Charles does a chore is \(0.85\)).\footnotemark{}

\footnotetext{This is another example of \emph{confusion of the
inverse}.}

\end{example}

Unlike the multiplication rule and Bayes' theorem, the extension of the
law of total probability is frequently cited when manipulating
probability mass functions. It is a process which is important enough so
as to warrant its own name: marginalization.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Marginalization}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

The idea with marginalization is that we are going to take a joint
probability mass function and \emph{marginalize it}, turning it into a
marginal distribution. This is analogous to the law of total
probability.

When dealing with a random variable, \(Y\), there is some set of numeric
values that \(Y\) can take on, namely the support of \(Y\), which we
denote \(\mathcal{Y}\). A natural partition of the space is to then take
each possible value for \(Y\) as the event, and simply enumerate through
the elements of \(\mathcal{Y}\).

Using this partition, we can ask about the ways that \(X\) can take on
any particular value. In order for \(X\) to be some specific value,
\(x'\), we know that \(Y\) must be one of the values,
\(y'\in\mathcal{Y}\). Thus, if we add up all the possible combinations,
\((X=x',Y=y_1)\), \((X=x',Y=y_2)\), and so forth, we will have covered
every possible way of making \(X=x'\). This is the exact same process we
used when looking at contingency tables, where we summed a row or column
to get the marginal probabilities.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-basic-partition-rv}This graphic shows the
partitioning of the sample space using a random variable. It is entirely
analogous to Figure~\ref{fig-basic-partition}, where in place of many
different events, we partition over the set of values for \(Y\). Here,
\(\mathcal{Y} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}\).}

\centering{

\includegraphics{graphics/ch5-basic-partition.png}

}

\end{figure}%

Taking this argument and encoding it with mathematical notation we get
that
\[P(X=x) = \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} P(X=x, Y=y) \implies p_X(x) = \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} p_{X,Y}(x,y).\]
The process of marginalization involves summing over one of the random
variables in a joint distribution, leaving behind only the marginal of
the other. This is often a very effective way of determining a marginal
distribution when information about two random variables is easier to
discern than information about only one.

To complete the analogy to the law of total probability, recall that the
multiplication rule tells us that \(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y)\),
and so we may also marginalize by taking
\[p_X(x) = \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y).\] This makes it
clear that marginalization is often accomplished via arguments based on
conditioning.

\end{tcolorbox}

When confronted with questions from statistics and probability, it will
often be the case that the natural answer to the question is ``it
depends.'' For instance, if asked ``what is the probability that a
student passes their next exam?'' the likely response is ``it depends.''
One very useful technique for solving these questions in a satisfactory
way is to continue that line of thought and explicitly specify ``on
what.'' In the previous example, you may say ``it depends on how much
they study.'' The conceit here is that, if you knew how much the student
studied, then you would better understand the outcomes of the student's
exam.

In mathematical terms this means you have a firm belief about the
conditional distribution between the random quantities of \emph{exam
performance} and \emph{study time}. The process of marginalization, and
the law of total probability before that, provide useful ways of being
able to translate these ``it depends'' statements into concrete beliefs
about the marginal probabilities. Recall that marginal distributions are
distributions which do not depend on any other quantity, and instead,
thy capture the overall behaviour of a random variable. They have, in
some sense, averaged out all other factors and give you the beliefs
which do not depend on anything else at all. The technique for
accomplishing this is marginalization.\footnote{We shall see other forms
  of these ``conditioning arguments'' in the next chapter, where we try
  to summarize the behaviour of a random variable.}

\begin{example}[Photos and Bird Sightings on their
Own]\protect\hypertarget{exm-conditioning}{}\label{exm-conditioning}

Recall that when Charles and Sadie go on their bird watching adventures,
Charles takes photos hoping for as many good ones as possible, and Sadie
spots the birds. We take \(X\) to be the number of good photos taken on
these trips, and \(Y\) to be the number of rare birds that are seen. We
noted that
\[p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!},\]
with \(0 \leq x \leq 10y\), and \(y \geq 0\).

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  To find \(p_Y(y)\), we marginalize over \(X\). That is, we sum the
  joint probability distribution function over all values for \(X\).
  This gives
  \[p_Y(y) = \sum_{x = 0}^{10y} p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \sum_{x = 0}^{10y} \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\]
\item
  To find \(p_X(x)\), we marginalize over \(Y\). That is, we sum the
  joint probability distribution function over all values for \(Y\).
  This gives
  \[p_X(x) = \sum_{y = 0}^{\infty} p_{X,Y}(x, y) = \sum_{y = 0}^{\infty} \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.\]
\item
  Note, that you will generally not be expected to manipulate these
  types of sums, however, it is possible to do. First, for \(p_Y(y)\),
  \begin{align*}
  p_Y(y) &= \sum_{x = 0}^{10y} \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}\times\frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!} \\
  &= \frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}\underbrace{\sum_{x = 0}^{10y} \binom{10y}{x}\times(0.25)^{x}\times(0.75)^{10y - x}}_{=1} \\
  &= \frac{e^{-3}3^y}{y!}.
  \end{align*}

\section{Independent and Identically Distributed: A Framework for
Interpretation}\label{independent-and-identically-distributed-a-framework-for-interpretation}

A very common assumption when addressing questions in statistics and in
probability is that we have a set of random variables which are
independent and identically distributed (often written iid). We now have
the tools to understand concretely what this means.

\begin{definition}[Independent and Identically Distributed
(iid)]\protect\hypertarget{def-iid}{}\label{def-iid}

A set of random variables, \(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n\) are said to be
independent and identically distributed (denoted iid) whenever:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  every subset of random variables in the collection is independent of
  every other subset of random variables in the collection; and
\item
  the marginal distribution for each of the random variables are exactly
  the same.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

The assumption of iid random quantities will often come up when we are
repeating a process many times over, and thinking about what
observations will arise from this. Suppose that \(X_1\) is a random
variable that takes the value \(1\) if a flipped coin comes up heads,
and \(0\) otherwise. If we imagine flipping this coin \(100\) times then
it is reasonable to assume that each sequential coin flip will be
independent of each other coin flip, since the result on one flip of a
coin should not influence the result of any other flip of a coin.
Moreover, every time the coin is flipped, it is reasonable to assume
that the probability it shows up heads remains the same. As a result,
these \(100\) random quantities, (\(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{100}\)), are
said to be iid.

\begin{example}[Reframing the Bird
Photos]\protect\hypertarget{exm-iid}{}\label{exm-iid}

Charles and Sadie had, to this point, been considering their bird photo
taking adventures in terms of the joint and conditional distributions.
After learning of independent and identically distributed random
variables, Charles thinks that there is another way to frame the setup,
and describes the following to Sadie:

\begin{quote}
Suppose it is known that there will be \(y\) birds seen on any given
day. Then, the total number of good pictures of birds can be viewed as
the sum of the number of good pictures of each bird. Thus, we can take a
set of iid random variables, say \(X_1,\dots,X_y\) which represent the
number of good pictures taken of each bird.
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Is this an accurate description? In reality, do we think that this
  will hold?
\item
  Supposing that this description is accurate, and that the probability
  mass function for each \(X_j\) is given by
  \[p_X(x) = \binom{10}{x}(0.25)^{x}(0.75)^{10-x},\] what is the joint
  probability mass function of \((X_1,\dots,X_y)\)?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Yes, this is a reasonable explanation. In this case, if Charles is
  willing to assume that good photos for one bird do not impact the
  chances of good photos of another bird, then this is a perfectly valid
  way to frame the setting. Note that in this case, \(Y=y\) is still
  random, so this whole description is conditioning on knowing \(Y=y\).
  In the real world, it is likely that photos may not actually be
  independent. If Charles takes some really bad photos of one bird, that
  may impact the chances of taking good photos of the next. However, it
  is likely close enough to correct in order to be true.
\item
  Recall that for independent random variables, the joint probability
  mass function is given by the product of the marginal probability mass
  functions. To simplify the notation, we will define
  \(T(X) = \sum_{i=1}^y x_i\). Thus the probability mass function of
  \(X_1,\dots,X_y\) is given by \begin{align*}
   p_{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_y}(x_1,\dots,x_y) &= \prod_{i=1}^y \binom{10}{x_i}(0.25)^{x_i}(0.75)^{10-x_i} \\
   &= \left(\prod_{i=1}^y\binom{10}{x_i}\right)\times(0.25)^{\sum_{i=1}^y x_i}(0.75)^{10y - \sum_{i=1}^yx_i} \\
   &= \left(\prod_{i=1}^y \frac{10!}{x_i!(10-x_i)!}\right)\times 0.25^{T(X)}\times 0.75^{10y - T(X)} \\
   &= \left(\frac{(10!)^y}{\prod_{i=1}^y x_i!(10 - x_i)!}\right)\times 0.25^{T(X)}\times 0.75^{10y - T(X)}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

While we will use the assumption of iid random variables explicitly at a
later point.The iid assumption also provides an intuitive method for
interpreting probability functions and distributions.

Suppose that we were to take a probability mass function, \(p_X(x)\). If
we were able to generate independent and identically distributed
realizations from this probability mass function, then the function
\(p_X(x)\) describes the behaviour for these repeated realizations.
Specifically, \(p_X(x)\) will give the long-run proportion of
realizations of the iid random variables which take the value \(x\).

This type of statement is always the flavour of interpretation
statements that are made with respect to probability and statistics. It
is always be the case that, in order to understand what is meant by a
statement of probability, we consider the repetition of some statistical
experiment over and over again. When we were discussing sample spaces
and experiments directly, we talked about repeating the experiment over
and over again. When we begin to work with random variables instead, it
becomes more natural to think about the replication procedures coming
through the use of independent and identically distributed random
variables.

As your study of probability progresses, you will begin to work with
random quantities in a strictly theoretical sense. In introductory level
problems, we are often holding in mind very concrete examples to
illustrate the procedures and concepts. In this setting it is easy
enough to hold in mind the experiment of interest: for instance, we may
have a random variable representing the result of a coin toss, and you
can envision repeatedly tossing a coin. As the concepts become less
concrete, more abstract, and harder to draw direct parallels to tangible
scenarios, it becomes more and more important to rely on the
interpretations rooted in a series of independent and identically
distributed random variables.

A large component of statistics as an area of study is making explicit
the assumptions we are working with, and doing our best to ensure that
these are reasonable. By interpreting probability mass functions as the
proportion of independent and identically distributed random variables
that take on a particular value when we repeatedly take realizations of
these random variables, this philosophy is made clear and explicit.

Variability}\label{the-expected-value-location-summaries-and-measures-of-variability}

\section{Summarizing the Location of a
Distribution}\label{summarizing-the-location-of-a-distribution}

Until this point in our discussions of probability we have relied upon
characterizing the behaviour of a random variable via the use of
probability mass functions. In some sense, a probability mass function
captures all of the probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random
variable. Using the mass function you are able to characterize how
often, in the long run, any particular value will be observed, and
answer any questions associated with this. As a result, the mass
function remains a critical area of focus for understanding how random
quantities behave.

However, these functions need to be explored and manipulated in order
for useful information to be extracted from them. They do not summarize
this behaviour effectively, as they are not intended to be a summary
tool. We may wish to have numeric quantities which are able to
\emph{concisely} express the behaviour of a distribution. Put
differently, provided with a probability mass function it is hard to
immediately answer ``what do we expect to happen with this random
variable?'' despite the fact that this is a very obvious first question.

To address questions related to our expectations, we turn towards the
statistical concept of central tendency or location.

\begin{definition}[Location (Central
Tendency)]\protect\hypertarget{def-location}{}\label{def-location}

The location of a distribution is a measure of a typical value, or a
central value, for that distribution. A measure of location may also be
referred to as a measure of central tendency.

\end{definition}

With measures of location we are trying to capture, with one single
number, what value is expected when we make observations from the random
quantity. There are many ways one might think to describe our
expectations, and it is worth exploring these concepts in some detail.
In particular, we want to explore how we might think to define the
\textbf{expected value} of a distribution.\footnote{As a general rule
  when learning it is often helpful to consider exercises of discovery.
  That is, try to determine \emph{why} particular definitions are the
  way that they are, or where they have from.}

\section{Deriving the Expected Value}\label{deriving-the-expected-value}

\subsection{The Mode}\label{the-mode}

One way that we may think to define our expected value is by asking what
value is the most probable. This is a question which can be directly
answered using the probability mass function. The process for this
requires looking at the function and determining which value for \(x\)
corresponds to the highest probability. This is the value that we are
most likely to see. Sometimes this procedure is fairly straightforward,
sometimes it is quite complicated. Regardless of the complexity of the
specific scenario, the most probable value has a straightforward
interpretation. As intuitive as this may seem, this is not the value
that will be used as \emph{the} expected value generally. Instead, this
quantity is referred to as the mode.

\begin{definition}[Mode]\protect\hypertarget{def-mode}{}\label{def-mode}

The mode of a distribution is the most probable value of that
distribution. Specifically, if \(X\) is a discrete random variable with
mass function \(p_X(x)\), then the mode is the value of \(x\) such that
\(p_X(x)\) is maximized.

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake
Sprinkles]\protect\hypertarget{exm-mode}{}\label{exm-mode}

Charles and Sadie have noticed that their favourite coffee shop has been
experiencing less foot traffic ever since \emph{Probability Patisserie:
Cupcake Conundrums} has opened up next door.\footnote{You should picture
  the owner of this fictitious cupcake store as a giant, multinational,
  faceless corporation. A corporation that seems to take pleasure in
  stepping on the local businesses. That way, as Charles and Sadie try
  to fight back, we can remain on their side!} This cupcake shop has
been attracting many of the regular customers, though, Charles and Sadie
think that it has more to do with fancy marketing than with a better
product. To this end, they go into the store and workout the probability
mass function for \(X\), the number of sprinkles on top of the cupcakes.
They find the following
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0.25 & x = 0 \\ 0.3 & x = 1 \\ 0.1 & x = 2 \\ 0.05 & x \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

What is the mode for the number of sprinkles on the cupcakes?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

The mode is the value \(x\) such that \(p_X(x)\) is a maximum. In this
case the maximum occurs when \(x=1\), with \(p_X(1) = 0.3\), and so the
mode of the number of sprinkles is \(1\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

While the mode is a useful quantity, and for some decisions will be the
most relevant summary value, there are some major issues with it as a
general measure of location. For starters, consider that our most common
probability model considered until this point has been that of equally
likely outcomes. Here, there is no well-defined mode.\footnote{When
  multiple modes exist, convention tends to report the set of all of the
  modes. In the equally likely outcome model, this is the entire support
  for the random variable, and as a result, the mode is exactly the
  probability mass function. There is no summary provided.} While the
case of equally likely outcomes is a fairly strong example highlighting
the issues with the mode, it need not be so dramatic to undermine its
utility. It is possible for a distribution to have several modes which
are quite distinct from one another, even if it's not all values in the
support.

Moreover, it is quite common for the modal value to be not particularly
likely itself. Consider a random variable that can take on a million
different values. If all of the probabilities are approximately
\(0.000001\) then presenting the mode as the most probable value does
not translate to saying that the mode is particularly probable.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake
Happiness]\protect\hypertarget{exm-triangular-distributions}{}\label{exm-triangular-distributions}

After realizing that the cupcake shop did not provide very many
sprinkles, Charles and Sadie decided to turn to the marketing material.
In it, \emph{Cupcake Conundrums} claims that, on a scale from \(0\) to
\(100,000\) happiness points, most of their customers experience the
maximum happiness after eating their cupcakes. Charles and Sadie are
well aware of the ways in which these types of reports can be
misleading, and so they investigate, finding the following probability
mass function for the number of happiness points.
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{x}{5,000,050,000} & x \in \{1,\dots,100 000\} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the mode reported by the company correct?
\item
  Is the mode an accurate depiction of the distribution in this setting?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Yes. Note that \(p_X(x)\) is increasing in \(x\). As a result, the
  mode of the distribution is the highest value that the distribution
  can take on, which in this case is \(x = 100,000\).
\item
  The mode is likely not a good indication of the distribution. Note
  that the maximal value happens only \(100000/5000050000\) of the time,
  which is a very very small value. If you look at the probability that
  a customer is only halfway happy, this is \(50000/5000050000\). This
  value is half the likelihood of the modal value, but the difference
  between these two probabilities is also only
  \(50000/5000050000 \approx 0.000001\). That is, it is only \(1\) in
  \(100,000\) more likely to observe perfect happiness compared with
  half happiness. By extension, it is only about \(2\) in \(100,000\)
  more likely to observe perfect happiness compared with no happiness.
  The mode simply is not a good indicator of behaviour in this setting.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{The Median}\label{the-median}

If the mode has these shortcomings, what else might work? Another
intuitive concept is to try to select the ``middle'' of the
distribution. One way to define the middle would be to select the value
such that, in the long run, half of observations from the distribution
are beneath it and half are above it. That way, when you are told this
value, you immediately know that it is equally likely to observe values
on either side of this mark. This is also a particularly intuitive
definition for expected value, and is important enough to be named, the
median.

\begin{definition}[Median]\protect\hypertarget{def-median}{}\label{def-median}

The median of a distribution is the value \(m\) which attempts to have
\(P(X \leq m) = 0.5\) and \(P(X \geq m) = 0.5\). This value may not
always exist, and so formally for discrete random variables, the median
\(m\) is any value such that \(P(X \leq m) \geq 0.5\) and
\(P(X \geq m) \geq 0.5\).

\end{definition}

The median is the midpoint of a distribution and is very important for
describing the behaviour of random variables. Medians are often the most
helpful single value to report to indicate the typical behaviour of a
distribution, and they are frequently used. When people interpret
averages it is often the median that they are actually interpreting. It
is very intuitive to be given a value and know that half of all
realizations are above that point, and half of all realizations are
below that point.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles
(Again)]\protect\hypertarget{exm-median}{}\label{exm-median}

After seeing how the cupcake shop used the mode to misrepresent the
happiness of its customers, Charles and Sadie worry that they may have
been unfair with using the mode. As a result, they turn back to the
cupcake sprinkle distribution and try to summarize it differently.
Recall that the probability mass function for \(X\), the number of
sprinkles on top of the cupcakes, is
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0.25 & x = 0 \\ 0.3 & x = 1 \\ 0.1 & x = 2 \\ 0.05 & x \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

What is the median number of sprinkles on the cupcakes?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Note that we are looking for a value, \(m\), such that
\(P(X \geq m) \geq 0.5\) and \(P(X \leq m) \geq 0.5\). To find this we
can consider the cumulative probability sums. We know that
\(P(X \leq k) = \sum_{x=0}^k p_X(x)\), and as a result, stopping this
value at the first time that the sum goes beyond \(0.5\) satisfies the
second condition. In this case our cumulative sums are \(0.25\) then
\(0.55\). As a result, \(P(X \leq 1) = 0.55 > 0.5\). If we check
\(P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 0.75 > 0.5\). As a result,
\(m=1\) satisfies the required conditions and is a median.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Despite the advantages of medians, they have their own drawbacks. For
starters, the median can be exceptionally challenging to compute in
certain settings. As a result, even when a median is appropriate, it may
not be desirable if it is too challenging to determine.

Beyond the difficulties in computation, medians have a feature which is
simultaneously a major benefit and a major drawback. Specifically,
medians are less influenced by extreme values in the probability
distribution. Consider two different distributions. The first is equally
likely to take any value between \(1\) and \(10\). The second is equally
likely to take any value between \(1\) and \(9\) or \(1,000,000\). In
both of these settings, the median is \(5\) since \(P(X\leq 5) = 0.5\)
and \(P(X \geq 5) = 0.5\). However, in the second setting we may observe
a value as high as \(1,000,000\). Moreover, this value will be observed
as often as the median will be.

The median, in some sense, ignores the extreme value in the probability
distribution. In certain settings, this can be very
desirable.\footnote{You will find many introductory sources that say
  that you should always use the median when you are concerned with
  extreme values. This is a great oversimplification of the truth, and
  points to a general rule in Statistics: there are very few general
  rules. The guidance comes from the fact that often extreme values skew
  our perceptions of the underlying truth. While this may be true in
  general, it is not true often enough to warrant being given as
  universal guidance.} Consider the distribution of household incomes.
There are a few households that earn an incredibly large amount,
compared to the remaining households. If you are interested in
understanding the ``average household'', the median may be a more
appropriate measure, as those households with extreme incomes would
otherwise distort the picture provided by most families. In this sense,
the median's robustness to extreme values is a positive feature of it in
terms of a summary measure for distributional behaviour.

Suppose instead that you work for an insurance company and are concerned
with understanding the value of insurance claims that your company will
need to pay out. The distribution will look quite similar to the income
distribution. Most of the probability will be assigned to fairly small
claims, with a small chance of a very large one. As an insurance
company, if you use the median this large claim behaviour will be
smoothed over, perhaps leaving you unprepared for the possibility of
extremely large payouts. In this setting, the extreme values are
informative and important, and as a result the median's robustness
becomes a hindrance to correctly describing the important
behaviour.\footnote{An insurance company ignoring these massive claims
  would almost certainly go out of business very, very quickly.}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Public
Relations]\protect\hypertarget{exm-median-two}{}\label{exm-median-two}

Charles and Sadie feel as though they may be finally catching a break
when word gets around that the cupcake shop was using spoiled
ingredients, making the patrons sick! The cupcake shop, in hearing this,
sent their massive public relations team into damage control mode. They
claimed that the median number of illnesses per week associated with the
cupcake store was the same as most local food services businesses. Doing
some digging, Charles and Sadie find the following two probability mass
functions, for \(X\) and \(Y\), where \(X\) is the number of weekly
illnesses at the cupcake shop, and \(Y\) is the number from a local
business that has been around for a while. \begin{align*}
p_X(x) &= \begin{cases}
    0.1 & x = 0 \\ 
    0.1 & x = 1 \\
    0.35 & x = 2 \\
    0.05 & x = 3 \\ 
    0.4 & x = 25 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise};
\end{cases} \\
p_Y(y) &= \begin{cases}
    0.45 & x = 0 \\
    0.04 & x = 1 \\
    0.5 & x = 2 \\

\end{cases}.

\tightlist
\item
  What is the median of \(X\)?
\item
  What is the median of \(Y\)?
\item

  of the world? Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  We can consider cumulative sums here again. In order we get, \(0.1\),
  \(0.2\), \(0.55\). This suggests that \(x=2\) is a candidate. If we
  check \(P(X \geq 2) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\), and so \(x=2\) is a median.
\item
  Using cumulative sums we get \(0.45\), \(0.49\), \(0.99\). Again, this
  gives \(x=2\) as a candidate. If we check
  \(P(X \geq 2) = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51\), and so \(x=2\) is a median.
\item
  The claim is accurate in that the median number for both
  establishments in \(2\). However, here the median is a bad
  representation for \(X\). The probability that more than \(2\) cases
  occur in a week at the cupcake shop is \(0.8\), compared with \(0.51\)
  at the local business. What's more, the probability that \(X\) is as
  high as \(25\) is \(0.4\), where \(Y\) is \emph{never} higher than
  \(3\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Between the median and the mode we have two measures which capture some
sense of expected value, each with their own set of strengths and
drawbacks. Neither capture what it is that is referred to as \emph{the}
expected value. For this, we need to take inspiration from the median,
and consider another way that we may think to find the center of the
distribution.

\subsection{The Mean}\label{the-mean}

If the median gives the middle reading along the values sequentially, we
may also wish to think about trying to find the \emph{center of gravity}
of the numbers. Suppose you take a pen, or marker, or small box of
chocolates, and you wish to balance this object on a finger or an arm.
To do so, you do not place the item so that half of its length sits on
one side of the appendage and half on the other. You adjust the location
so that half of the \emph{mass} sits on either side of the appendage.

Throughout our discussion of discrete random variables we have referred
to probability as \emph{mass}. We use the \emph{probability mass
function} to generate our probability values. This metaphor can be
extended when we try to find the center of the distribution. If we
imagine placing a mass with weight equal to the probability mass at each
value that a random variable can take on, we may ask, ``where would we
have to place a fulcrum to have this number line be balanced?'' The
answer to this question serves as another possible measure of center. It
turns out that this notion of center is the one that we are all most
familiar with, the simple average, or mean.

\begin{definition}[Mean]\protect\hypertarget{def-mean}{}\label{def-mean}

The mean of a distribution is the center of mass of the distribution.
For a random variable, \(X\) with support \(\mathcal{X}\), and
probability mass function \(p_X(x)\), the mean of \(X\) is given by
\[\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} xp_X(x).\]

\end{definition}

It is this measure of location which ends up being called the
\textbf{expected value} in statistics. We will use average, expected
value, mean, and expectation interchangeably. In terms of notation, the
expected value of a random variable \(X\) is denoted \(E[X]\).
Mathematically, the expected value is desirable for many reasons, some
of which we will study in more depth later on. One of these desirable
features, which stands in contrast with the median, is the comparative
ease with which expected values can be computed. The summation for the
expected value is easy to write down, and typically can be solved
(either analytically, or readily with a computer).

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Investigate Cupcake Sprinkles (One
Last
Time)]\protect\hypertarget{exm-expected-value-one}{}\label{exm-expected-value-one}

While the median and mode number of sprinkles on the cupcakes were the
same, Charles and Sadie realize that this does not end up connecting
well with the total number of sprinkles given out. Perhaps customers
like the possibility of getting a large number of sprinkles, if they get
lucky. As a result, they decide to round out the summary of the
distribution by considering the mean number of sprinkles as well. Recall
that the probability mass function for \(X\), the number of sprinkles on
top of the cupcakes, is
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0.25 & x = 0 \\ 0.3 & x = 1 \\ 0.1 & x = 2 \\ 0.05 & x \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

What is the mean number of sprinkles?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Recall that the mean of a distribution is given by
\(E[X] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xP_X(x)\). In this case, this results in
\begin{align*}
    &\sum_{x=0}^9 xp_X(x) \\
    &= 0(0.25) + 1(0.3) + 2(0.1) + (3+4+5+6+7+8+9)(0.05) \\
    &= 2.6.
\end{align*} As a result, the mean number of sprinkles used is \(2.6\).
This is higher than the median and mode, but is still not particularly
high.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

In the case of an equally likely probability model, the expected value
becomes the standard average that is widely used. Suppose that there are
\(n\) options in the support with \(\mathcal{X} = \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\).
We can write
\[E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i.\]
This is the formula for the average that is most commonly applied. When
the probability models are more complex, the formula is not precisely
the standard average -- instead, it becomes a weighted average, where
the weights are the probabilities.\footnote{While less commonly applied
  than the simple average, a weighted average is familiar to most
  students for a crucial purpose: grade calculations. If you view the
  weight of each item in a course as a probability mass, and the grade
  you scored as the value, then your final grade in the course is
  exactly the expected value of this distribution.} The frequency with
which expected values are used make them attractive as a quick summary
for the center of a distribution.

\subsection{How is the Mean
``Expected''?}\label{how-is-the-mean-expected}

While the mean provides a useful, intuitive measure of center of the
distribution, it is perhaps counterintuitive to name it the ``expected
value.'' To understand the naming convention it is easiest to consider
the application which has likely spurred more development of statistics
and probability than any other: gambling.

Suppose that there is some game of chance that can pay out different
amounts with different probabilities. A critical question for a gambler
in deciding whether or not to play such a game is ``how much can I
expect to earn, if I play?'' This is crucial to understanding, for
instance, how much you should be willing to pay to participate, or if
you are the one running the game, how much you should charge to ensure
that you make a profit.

If you want to understand what you expect to earn, the intuitive way of
accomplishing this is to weight each possible outcome by how likely it
is to occur. This is exactly the expected value formula that has been
provided, and so the expected value can be thought of as the expected
payout of a game of chance where the outcomes are payouts corresponding
to each probability.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Cost for a Game of Chance}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Suppose that a game of chance is being run. It will cost \(\$m\) to
play, and the game will pay out values from \(\mathcal{X}\), according
to a random variable \(X\) with probability mass function \(p_X(x)\).
The question that we want to know is what should the value be for \(m\),
such that, in the long term, a player playing the game will earn no
money?

Note that if \(X=x\) then a player playing the game will earn \(x - m\)
for that play, and this will happen with probability \(p_X(x)\). Thus,
in the long run, in \(p_X(x)\) proportion of games the player earns
\(x-m\). If the player plays \(N\) games, then as \(N\to\infty\), the
total contribution from these winnings will be
\((x-m)\cdot N\cdot p_X(x)\). If we add up this contribution for all
possible results, \(x\), we get \begin{align*}
\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} N(x-m)p_X(x) &= N\left[\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} mp_X(x)\right] \\
&= N\left[\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) - m\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_X(x)\right] \\
&= N\left[E[X] - m\right].
\end{align*} Thus, in the long run, the total that the player wins, as
\(N\to\infty\) will be \(N(E[X] - m)\). Thus, in order for the long run
earnings to be zero, \(m\) should be set to be equal to \(E[X]\).

If \(m\) is set to be \(0\), then per game the player \emph{expects} to
earn \(E[X]\). This also represents the cost at which a rational actor
should be willing to pay to participate. If a game of chance costs more
than the expected value to play, in the long run you will lose money. If
a game of chance costs less than the expected value, in the long run you
will earn money. It is hard to overstate the utility of gambling in
developing probability theory, and as such these types of connections
are expected.

\end{tcolorbox}

To interpret the expected value of a random variable, one possibility is
using the intuition that we used to derive the result. Notably, the
expected value is the center of mass of the distribution, where the
masses correspond to probabilities. This means that it is not
necessarily an actual central number over the range, but rather that it
sits in the weighted middle. While this interpretation is useful in many
situations, there are times where the point of balance is a less
intuitive description. For these, it can sometimes be useful to frame
the expected value as the long term simple average from the
distribution.

If we imagine observing many independent and identically distributed
random variables, then as the number of samples tends to infinity, the
expected value of \(X\) and the simple average will begin to coincide
with one another. That is the distance between \(E[X]\) and
\(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\) will shrink to \(0\). As a result, we
can view the expected value as the average over repeated experiments.
This interpretation coincides nicely with the description based on games
of chance. Specifically, if you were to repeatedly play the same game of

\section{Which Measure of Central Tendency Should be
Used?}\label{which-measure-of-central-tendency-should-be-used}

Where the median demonstrated robustness against extreme values in the
distribution, the mean does not. For instance, if we consider the
distribution of incomes across a particular region, the mean will be
much higher than the median, since those families with exceptionally
high incomes will not be smoothed over as they were with medians. In
this case, the lack of robustness for the expected value will render the
mean a less representative summary for the true behaviour of the random
quantity.

To see this concretely consider a random variable which with equal
probability takes a value between \(1\) and \(9\). This will have
\(E[X] = 5\). Now, if the \(9\) is made to be \(1,000,000\), the
expected value will now be \(E[X] = 111115.\dot1\). This is a far cry
from the median which does not change from \(5\) in either case. This
lack of robustness is desirable in the event of the insurance example
from the median discussion, but will be less desirable in other
settings.

The mean, median, and mode are the three standard measures of central
tendency. They are single values which describe the standard behaviour
of a random quantity. Each of the three has merits as a measure, and
each has drawbacks for certain settings. The question of which to use
and when depends primarily on the question of interest under
consideration, rather than on features of the data alone.\footnote{The
  data is one consideration for which measure to use, but not the only
  one (and not the most important one).} Often, presenting more than one
measure can give a better sense of the distributional behaviour that any
one individual will.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Reflect on the Cupcake
Adventures]\protect\hypertarget{exm-choosing-measure-of-central-tendency}{}\label{exm-choosing-measure-of-central-tendency}

Charles and Sadie decide it is worth stepping back and summarizing all
that has happened with regards to their cupcake adventures, trying to
ensure that distributions are always summarized fairly.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For the number of sprinkles per cupcake is the mean, median, or mode
  the best measure of central tendency?
\item
  For the amount happiness in customers, is the mean, median, or mode
  the best measure of central tendency?
\item
  For the number of customers who become ill eating at establishments,
  is the mean, median, or mode the best measure of central tendency?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  There is an argument that any of the measures here could work the
  best, it would depend on the individual's preferences. The mode makes
  a lot of sense as, if you are a regular customer, the mode is what you
  will experience day-to-day; most days you will have the modal number
  of sprinkles. The median may make sense as it provides a benchmark for
  measuring what constitutes a lot of sprinkles and a little. Half of
  the time you'll end up with a more sprinkled donut, half the time a
  less. The mean would be particularly interesting to note for the store
  owners themselves, since the mean is directly tied to totals: if the
  store knows that they sell \(100\) cupcakes per day, most days, then
  they also can expect to use \(100\) times the mean number of sprinkles
  in a day. This is helpful for planning.
\item
  The median is likely the most useful measure in this setting. The mode
  could be useful if happiness were not measured on a \(100,000\) point
  scale. The mean is likely a less relevant value here as we are not
  particularly concerned with the total happiness, and if there was a
  large skew or major outliers in this distribution, we would want to
  determine where the majority fall. This is more analogous to the
  income example rather than the insurance example.
\item
  In this case either the mode or mean are likely the best gauges. Here
  we do care about totals, and in particular, we do not want to smooth
  over outliers. It is very relevant if sometimes a lot of individuals
  become ill after eating an establishment, and the median would hide
  this information.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Despite the utility of all three measures, the expected value holds a
place of more central importance in probability and statistics. A lot of
this has to do with further mathematical properties of the mean. Because
of its central role, it is worth studying the expected value in some
more depth.

\section{Expected Values of Functions of Random
Variables}\label{expected-values-of-functions-of-random-variables}

Sometimes the value of a random variable needs to be mapped through a
function to give the value which is most relevant to us. Consider, for
instance, a situation wherein the side lengths of boxes being
manufactured by a specific supplier are random, due to incorrectly
calibrated tolerances in the machines. The resulting boxes are perfect
cubes. Suppose we are interested in the volume of the produced box not
the side length. If a box has side length \(x\), then its volume will be
\(x^3\), and so we may desire some way of computing \(E[X^3]\) rather
than \(E[X]\).

Generally, for a function \(g(X)\), we may want to compute \(E[g(X)]\).
It is important to recognize that \(E[g(X)] \neq g(E[X])\). This is a
common mistake.\footnote{and an attractive one, but a mistake
  nonetheless.} If we are unable to apply the function to the expected
value, then the question of how to compute the expected value remains.
Instead of applying the function to overall expected value, instead, we
apply the function to \emph{each} value in the defining relationship for
the expected value. That is,
\[E[g(X)] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x).\] This is sometimes
referred to as the ``law of the unconscious statistician,'' a name which
may be aggressive enough to help remember the correct way to compute the
expectation.\footnote{Some statisticians dislike this name. I find it to
  be rather cute.}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Law of the Unconscious Statistician}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

The law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS) states that, for a
random variable \(X\), if we wish to find \(E[g(X)]\), then we compute
\[E[g(X)] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x).\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{example}[The Happiness Scale
Inversion]\protect\hypertarget{exm-expected-value-transformation}{}\label{exm-expected-value-transformation}

Charles and Sadie have made really great strides working to protect
their favourite coffee shop from the new cupcake store. One day when
digging through the material more, they realize that the happiness
report produced by the company is even less accurate than they had
originally reported! The company reported the following probability mass
function for happiness points \[
p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{x}{5,000,050,000} & x \in \{1,\dots,100 000\} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\] Charles and Sadie track down the source of this expression
and they find that, in fact, this does not measure happiness points at
all. Instead, the number of happiness points is a function of \(X\),
specifically, \(Z = 1/X\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the expected value of \(X\)? Note, it may be helpful to recall
  that \(\sum_{x=1}^{k} x^2 = \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}\).
\item
  What is the expected value of \(Z\)?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Using directly the formula for \(E[X]\) gives \begin{align*}
  E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{100000} xp_X(x) &= \sum_{x=1}^{100000} x\frac{x}{5000050000} \\
  &= \frac{1}{5000050000}\sum_{x=1}^{100000}x^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{5000050000}\cdot\frac{100000(100000+1)(2(100000)+1)}{6} \\
  &= 66 667.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Applying the law of the unconscious statistician, gives \begin{align*}
  E[Z] = E[1/X] = \sum_{x=1}^{100000} \frac{1}{x}p_X(x) &= \sum_{x=1}^{100000} \frac{1}{x}\frac{x}{5000050000} \\
  &= \frac{1}{5000050000}\sum_{x=1}^{100000} 1 \\
  &= \frac{100000}{5000050000} \\
  &= \frac{2}{100001}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

These functions applied to random variables are often thought of as
``transformations'' of the random quantities. For instance, we
\emph{transformed} a side length into a volume. While the law of the
unconscious statistician will apply to any transformation for a random
variable, we can sometimes use shortcuts to circumvent its application.
In particular, when \(g(X) = aX + b\), for constant numbers \(a\) and
\(b\), we can greatly simplify the expected value of the transformation.
To see this note \begin{align*}
E[aX + b] &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}(ax + b)p_X(x) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}axp_X(x) + bp_X(x) \\
&= a\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + b\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_X(X) \\
&= aE[X] + b.
\end{align*} That is, in general, we have that
\(E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b\). Note that part of the property of the
linearity of expectation that we can immediately see if that the
expected value of any constant is always that constant. If we take
\(a = 0\), then we see that \(E[aX + b] = E[b] = b\). Thus, any time
that we need to take the expected value of any constant number, we know
that it is just that number.

This is particularly useful as linear transformations like \(aX+b\)
arise very commonly. For instance, most unit conversions are simple
linear combinations. If a random quantity is measured in one unit then
this result can be used to quickly convert expectations to another.

\begin{example}[Sadie's Trip to
America]\protect\hypertarget{exm-temperature-conversion}{}\label{exm-temperature-conversion}

Sadie has recently returned from a long trip to America. The trip was
long enough that temperatures measured in Fahrenheit started to make
sense. When Sadie and Charles begin to talk about the weather, Charles
brings up the temperature distribution of a possible summer vacation
spot. Unfortunately for Sadie, these temperatures are all in Celsius.
The distribution Charles provides is \[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    0.1 & x \in \{10, 11, 12, 13, 14\} \\
    0.05 & x \in \{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the expected temperature, in Celsius?
\item
  Supposing that the temperature in Fahrenheit is given by
  \(Y = 1.8X + 32\), what is the expected temperature in Fahrenheit?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Here we find \begin{align*}
   \sum_{x=10}^{24} xp_X(x) &= 0.1\sum_{x=10}^{14}x + 0.05\sum_{x=15}^{24}x \\
   &= 15.75.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Since \(E[X] = 15.75\) then
  \(E[Y] = E[1.8X + 32] = 1.8E[X] + 32 = 60.35\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

This type of linear transformation also frequently comes up with games
of chance and payouts, or with scoring more generally.\footnote{For
  instance, suppose you are betting a certain amount on the results of a
  coin toss, or that you are taking a multiple choice test that gives
  \(2\) points for a correct answer.} Beyond being linear over simple
transformations, summations in general behave nicely with expectations.
Specifically, for any quantities separated by addition, say
\(g(X) + h(X)\), the expected value will be the sum of each expected
value. Formally, \begin{align*}
E[g(X) + h(X)] &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} (g(x) + h(x))p_X(x) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x) + h(x)p_X(x) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} g(x)p_X(x) + \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} h(x)p_X(x) \\
&= E[g(X)] + E[h(X)].
\end{align*}

Behaving well under linearity is one of the very nice properties of
expectations. It will come in useful when dealing with a large variety
of important quantities, and as we will see shortly, this linearity will
also extend to multiple different random quantities.

Measures of central tendency are important to summarize the behaviour of
a random quantity. Whether using the mean, median, or mode, these
measures of location describe, on average, what to expect from
observations of the random quantity. However, understanding a
distribution requires understanding far more than simply the measures of
location. As was discussed previously, the probability mass function
captures the complete probabilistic behaviour of a discrete random
variable, it is only intuitive that some information would be lost with
a single numeric summary.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Equal Location Across Different Distributions}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Consider the following three distributions for three random variables,
\(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\): \begin{align*}
p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    0.25 & x = -1 \\
    0.5 & x = 0 \\ 
    0.25 & x = 1 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases} \quad
p_Y(y) &= \begin{cases}
    0.05 & x = -5 \\
    0.1 & x = -4 \\
    0.1 & x = -3 \\
    0.1 & x = -2\\
    0.1 & x = -1\\
    0.15 & x = 0 \\ 
    0.1 & x = 1\\
    0.1 & x = 2\\
    0.1 & x = 3\\
    0.1 & x = 4 \\
    0.05 & x = 5 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases} \quad
p_Z(z) = \begin{cases}
    0.25 & x = -400 \\
    0.5 & x = 0 \\
    \frac{1}{3196} & x \in \{1,\dots,799\}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}.
\end{align*}

In each of these distributions we have the mean, median, and mode all
equalling \(0\).\footnotemark{} However, even just from a quick glance,
these distributions are all very, very differently behaved. The location
summaries here clearly miss much of the important information about
these different distributions. Spend some time trying to think of the
ways in which they differ from one another, and see if you can determine
\emph{what} is missing from relying solely on measures of location.

\section{Summarizing the Variability of a Random
Variable}\label{summarizing-the-variability-of-a-random-variable}

A key characteristic of the behaviour of a random variable which is not
captured by the measures of location is the variability of the quantity.
If we imagine taking repeated realizations of a random variable, the
variability of the random variable captures how much movement there will
be observation to observation. If a random variable has low variability,
we expect that the various observations will cluster together, becoming
not too distant from one another. If a random variable has high
variability, we expect the observations to jump around each time.

\section{The Range}\label{the-range}

Just as was the case with measures of location, there are several
measures of variability which may be applicable in any given setting.
One fairly basic measure of this variability is the range of possible
values: what is the highest possible value, what is the lowest possible
value, and how much distance is there between those two points?

\begin{definition}[Range]\protect\hypertarget{def-range}{}\label{def-range}

For a random variable, \(X\), the range of the random variable is
defined as \(\text{Range}(X) = \max(X) - \min(X)\). That is, it is the
distance between the maximum value that the random variable can take on,
and the minimum value that the random variable can take on. Sometimes
the range is reported with these outpoints explicitly specified.

\end{definition}

This is a fairly intuitive notion, and is particularly useful in the
equal probability model over a sequence of numbers. Consider dice. Dice
are typically defined by the range of values that they occupy, say \(1\)
to \(6\), or \(1\) to \(20\). Once you know the values present on any
die, you have a sense for how much the values can move observation to
observation.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Explore Ice Cream
Flavors]\protect\hypertarget{exm-range-works}{}\label{exm-range-works}

Charles and Sadie have decided to spend their sunny afternoon exploring
various ice cream flavors at their local parlor, \emph{Symmetric
Scoops}. They notice that Scoops Galore offers a wide variety of
flavors, from classic vanilla to exotic dragon fruit swirl. Intrigued by
the selection, they decide to investigate the probability distribution
of a random variable, \(Y\), representing the number of unique flavors a
customer selects.

After discreetly observing several customers, Charles and Sadie jot down
their findings: \[
p_Y(y) = \begin{cases} 
0.2 & y = 1 \\
0.35 & y = 2 \\
0.3 & y = 3 \\
0.15 & y = 4 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

What is the range of the random variable \(Y\), representing the number
of unique ice cream flavors a customer selects at Scoops Galore?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Looking at the defining relationship for this random variable, we can
see that the maximum value the distribution can take on is \(4\) (with
probability \(0.15\)) and the minimum value is \(1\) (with probability
\(0.2\)). As a result, we say that \(\text{Range}(Y) = 4 - 1 = 3\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

While the range is an important measure to consider to determine the
behaviour of a random variable, it is a fairly crude measurement. It may
be the case that, while the extreme values are possible, they are
sufficiently unlikely so as to come up very infrequently and not remain
representative of the likely spread of observations. Alternatively, many
random variables have a theoretically infinite range. In these cases,
providing the range will likely not provide much utility.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Explore Ice Cream Flavors,
Again]\protect\hypertarget{exm-range-dnw}{}\label{exm-range-dnw}

Having had so much fun at \emph{Symmetric Scoops} the first time,
Charles and Sadie return once more to continue to investigate customers
behaviour. When they arrive they notice a temporary promotion going on,
which happens on one randomly selected Sunday a year, where customers
can buy a \emph{Mega Sunda(y)e Extravaganza}, a wonderfully extravagant
creation that features scoops from all \(50\) flavours on offer. Working
on this today they find the following probability mass function for
\(Y\). \[
p_Y(y) = \begin{cases} 
0.2 & y = 1 \\
0.35 & y = 2 \\
0.3 & y = 3 \\
0.145 & y = 4 \\
0.005 & y = 50 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

What is the range of the random variable \(Y\) now? Does this accurately
represent the dispersion we expect from \(Y\)?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Looking at the defining relationship for this random variable, we can
see that the maximum value the distribution can take on is \(50\) (with
probability \(0.005\)) and the minimum value is \(1\) (with probability
\(0.2\)). As a result, we say that \(\text{Range}(Y) = 50 - 1 = 49\).
This does \textbf{not} accurately represent the dispersion of the random
variable. Not only do very few customers order this when it is
available, it is also almost never available. As a result, the maximum
value (while possible) is not reflective of the usual behaviour of this
random quantity, and this displays one of the concerns with the range as
a measure of spread.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{The Interquartile Range}\label{the-interquartile-range}

To remedy these two issues, we may think of techniques to modify the
range. Instead of taking the minimum and maximum possible values, we can
instead consider ranges of values which remain more plausible. A common
way to do this is to extend our concept of a median beyond the half-way
point. The median of a random variable \(X\), is the value, \(m\), such
that \(P(X \leq m) = 0.5\)\footnote{And, as a result, \(P(X > m) = 0.5\)
  as well.}. While there is good reason to care about the midpoint, we
can think of generalizing this to be \emph{any} probability.

That is, we could find a number \(z\), such that \(P(X \leq z) = 0.1\).
We could then use this value to conclude that the probability of
observing a value less than \(z\) is \(10\%\). These values are referred
to, generally, as \textbf{percentiles} and they are the natural
extension of medians.

\begin{definition}[]\protect\hypertarget{def-percentile}{}\label{def-percentile}

The \(100p\)th percentile (e.g., \(70\)th percentile for \(p=0.7\), or
\(20\)th percentile for \(p=0.20\)), is denoted \(\zeta(p)\) and is the
value such that \(P(X \leq \zeta(p)) = p\). Thus, the median is given by
\(\zeta(0.5)\) and is also called the \(50\)th percentile.\footnote{Note
  that, when dealing with discrete random variables, it may not be
  possible to find a value \(\zeta(p)\) such that
  \(P(X \leq \zeta(p)) = p\) exactly. Instead, we typically define the
  percentile here to be such that
  \(P(X < \zeta(p)) < p \leq P(X \leq \zeta(p))\).}

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Perplexed at the Ice Cream
Parlour]\protect\hypertarget{exm-percentile}{}\label{exm-percentile}

Charles and Sadie remained somewhat disappointed by their lack of
ability to accurately capture the behaviour of a random variable using
the range. To this end, they spend a lot more time at the ice cream
parlor, and come up with, what they believe, is the correct probability
mass function for how many flavours customers order, in total. \[
p_Y(y) = \begin{cases} 
    0.25 & y = 1 \\
    0.25 & y = 2 \\
    0.1 & y = 3 \\
    0.05 & y = 4 \\
    0.05 & y = 5 \\
    0.05 & y = 6 \\
    0.15 & y = 7 \\
    0.05 & y = 8 \\
    0.04 & y = 9 \\
    0.005 & y = 10 \\ 
    0.005 & y = 50 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Using this probability mass function, find \(\zeta(0.25)\),
\(\zeta(0.5)\), \(\zeta(0.75)\), and \(\zeta(0.99)\). What do each of
these values mean?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\zeta(0.25)\) is found by looking for
  \(P(Y \leq \zeta(0.25)) = 0.25\). We note that
  \(P(Y \leq 1) = P(Y = 1) = 0.25\), and so \(\zeta(0.25) = 1\). This
  means that there is a \(25\%\) chance that a randomly selected
  individual will order \(1\) or fewer flavours.
\item
  \(\zeta(0.5)\) is found by looking for
  \(P(Y \leq \zeta(0.5)) = 0.25\). Note that
  \(P(Y \leq 2) = P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2) = 0.5\), and so
  \(\zeta(0.5) = 2\). This means that \(50\%\) of customers order \(2\)
  or fewer flavours, and \(50\%\) of customers order more than \(2\)
  flavours.
\item
  \(\zeta(0.75)\) is found by looking for
  \(P(Y \leq \zeta(0.75)) = 0.75\). Note that we can continue the
  cumulative sums from the probability mass function. This gives, in
  order, \(0.25, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.995, 1\).
  As a result, \(P(Y \leq 6) = 0.75\) and so \(\zeta(0.75) = 6\). This
  means that \(75\%\) of customers order \(7\) or fewer flavours (the
  remaining \(25\%\) order more than \(7\)).
\item
  \(\zeta(0.99)\) can be found through the same cumulative sums as in
  (c). This is given by \(y = 9\), such that \(P(Y \leq 9) = 0.99\), so
  \(\zeta(0.99) = 9\). This means that \(99\%\) of individuals order
  \(9\) or fewer flavours.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

We can leverage percentiles to remedy some of the issues with the range
as a measure of variability. Framed in terms of percentiles, the minimum
value is \(\zeta(0)\), and the maximum value is \(\zeta(1)\). Instead of
considering the extreme endpoints, we can consider the difference
between more moderate percentiles. Doing so allows us to overcome the
major concerns outlined with the range. If we take \(\zeta(p_1)\) and
\(\zeta(p_2)\), for \(p_1 < p_2\), then the difference between
\(\zeta(p_2) - \zeta(p_1)\) can be seen as a measure of variability,
analogous to the range.

The most common choices would be to take \(\zeta(0.25)\) and
\(\zeta(0.75)\), the \(25\)th and \(75\)th percentiles, respectively.
These are also referred to as the first and third quartiles,
respectively. They are named as, taking \(\zeta(0.25)\), \(\zeta(0.5)\)
and \(\zeta(0.75)\), the distribution is cut into quarters.

With the first and third quartiles computed, we can compute the
\textbf{interquartile range}, which is given by
\(\zeta(0.75)-\zeta(0.25)\).

\begin{definition}[Interquartile Range
(IQR)]\protect\hypertarget{def-iqr}{}\label{def-iqr}

The interquartile range, or IQR, is defined as
\(\zeta(0.75) - \zeta(0.25)\), the difference between the third and
first quartiles. It is a measure of spread, and is typically denoted as
\(\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1\), where \(Q\) stands for quartiles.

\end{definition}

Like the range, the IQR gives a measure of how much spread there tends
to be in a distribution. Unlike the range, however, we can be more
certain that both the first and third quartiles are reasonable values
around which repeated observations of the random variable would be
observed. Specifically, there is a probability of \(0.5\) that a value
between the first and third quartile will be observed. The larger the
\(\text{IQR}\), the more spread out these moderate observations will be,
and as a result, the more variable the distribution is.

\begin{example}[Addressing the Ice Cream
Perplexity]\protect\hypertarget{exm-percentile}{}\label{exm-percentile}

Having understood many of the percentiles of the distribution of ice
cream flavours ordered at \emph{Symmetric Scoops}, Charles and Sadie
decide to have another shot at capturing the spread. Recall that the
probability mass function for \(Y\), the number of ice cream flavours
ordered by a customer, is given by \[
p_Y(y) = \begin{cases} 
0.25 & y = 1 \\
0.25 & y = 2 \\
0.1 & y = 3 \\
0.05 & y = 4 \\
0.05 & y = 5 \\
0.05 & y = 6 \\
0.15 & y = 7 \\
0.05 & y = 8 \\
0.04 & y = 9 \\
0.005 & y = 10 \\ 
0.005 & y = 50 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

What is the interquartile range for this population? How does this
compare to the range?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We know that \(\zeta(0.25) = 1\) and \(\zeta(0.75) = 6\). As a result,
the \(\text{IQR} = 6 - 1 = 5\). By contrast, the range is given by
\(50 - 1 = 49\). It is incredibly rare to observe a customer ordering
\(50\) flavours, as a result, using \(5\) is a better measure of spread
of the distribution. To see this, we could consider plotting a histogram
(more on these later on) that show the number of customers who order
each type, and then intuitively as for a good measure of how
\emph{spread out} the data are.

\section{The Variance and Mean Absolute
Deviation}\label{the-variance-and-mean-absolute-deviation}

Both the range and the interquartile range give a sense of the variation
in the distribution irrespective of the measures of location for that
distribution. Another plausible method for assessing the variability of
a distribution is to assess how far we expect observations to be from
its center. Intuitively, if observations of \(X\) are near the center
with high probability, then the distribution will be less variable than
if the average distance to the center is larger.

This intuitive measure of variability is useful for capturing the
behaviour of a random variable, particularly when paired with a measure
of location. However, we do have to be careful: not all measures of
dispersion based on this notion will be useful. Consider the most basic
possibility, \(X - E[X]\). We might ask, for instance, what is the
expected value of this quantity. If we take \(E[X - E[X]]\) then note
that this a linear combination in expectation since \(E[X]\) is just
some number. Thus, \(E[X-E[X]] = E[X] - E[X] = 0\). In other words, the
expected difference between a random variable and its mean is exactly
\(0\). We thus need to think harder about how best to turn this
intuition into a useful measure of spread.

The issue with this procedure is that some realizations are going to be
below the mean, making the difference negative, and some will be above
the mean, making the difference positive. Our defining relationship for
the mean relied on balancing these two sets of mass. However, when
discussing the variability of the random variable, we do not much care
whether the observations are lower than expected or higher than
expected, we simply care how much variability there is around what is
expected. To remedy this, we should consider only the distance between
the observation and the expectation, not the sign. That is, if \(X\) is
\(5\) below \(E[X]\) we should treat that the same as if \(X\) is \(5\)
above \(E[X]\).

There are two common ways to turn value into its magnitude in
mathematics generally: squaring the number and using absolute values.
Both of these tactics are useful approaches to defining measures of
spread, and they result in the \textbf{variance} when using the expected
value of the squared deviations, and the \textbf{mean absolute
deviation} when using the absolute value. While \(E[|X-E[X]|]\) is
perhaps the more intuitive quantity to consider, generally speaking it
will not be the one that we use.

\begin{definition}[Variance]\protect\hypertarget{def-variance}{}\label{def-variance}

The variance of a random variable, typically denoted \(\text{var}(X)\),
is given by the expected value of the squared deviations of a random
variable from its mean. That is,
\[\text{var}(X) = E\left[(X - E[X])^2\right].\]

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Mean Absolute
Deviation]\protect\hypertarget{def-MAD}{}\label{def-MAD}

The mean absolute deviation of a random variable, typically denoted
\(\text{MAD}(X)\), is given by the expected value of the absolute value
of the deviations of a random variable from its mean. That is,
\[\text{MAD}(X) = E\left[|X - E[X]|\right].\]

\end{definition}

In general when we need a positive quantity in mathematics it will
typically be preferable to consider the square to the absolute
value.\footnote{The reasons for this are plentiful, but generally
  squares are easier to handle than absolute values, and as a result
  become more natural quantities to consider.} The variance is
\textbf{the} central measure of deviation for random variables. When
discussing the variability of a random variable, it will almost
universally be in reference to the variance.

Note that if we take \(g(X) = (X-E[X])^2\), then the variance of \(X\)
is the expected value of a transformation. We have seen that to compute
these we apply the law of the unconscious statistician, and substitute
\(g(X)\) into the defining relationship for the expected value, which
for the variance gives
\[\text{var}(X) = \sum_{x\in\in\mathcal{X}} (x-E[X])^2p_X(x).\] In order
to compute the variance, we must also find the mean as the function
\(g(X)\) relies upon this value.

\begin{example}[Variation in the Number of Ice Cream Flavours
Ordered]\protect\hypertarget{exm-variance}{}\label{exm-variance}

Noting how different the range and IQR were of the distribution of
number of different flavours ordered by customers at the ice cream
parlour, Charles and Sadie decide to turn to the variance and mean
absolute deviation to try understand the distribution's variability
once-and-for-all. Recall that the probability mass function for \(Y\),
the number of ice cream flavours ordered by a customer, is given by \[
p_Y(y) = \begin{cases} 
0.25 & y = 1 \\
0.25 & y = 2 \\
0.1 & y = 3 \\
0.05 & y = 4 \\
0.05 & y = 5 \\
0.05 & y = 6 \\
0.15 & y = 7 \\
0.05 & y = 8 \\
0.04 & y = 9 \\
0.005 & y = 10 \\ 
0.005 & y = 50 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Find the variance and the mean absolute variation for this distribution.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

For both \(\text{var}(Y)\) and \(\text{MAD}(Y)\) we require the expected
value of \(Y\). To this end note that
\begin{multline*}E[Y] = (0.25)(1) + (0.25)(2) + (0.1)(3) + (0.05)(4) + (0.05)(5) + (0.05)(6) + (0.15)(7) \\ + (0.05)(8) + (0.04)(9) + (0.005)(10) + (0.005)(50) = 3.91.\end{multline*}

Then, it can be useful to define a table with the probabilities,
absolute, and squared deviations, so that the summations can be made
easier.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\(Y\) & \(p_Y(y)\) & \((Y - E[Y])^2\) & \(|Y - E[Y]|\) \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\(1\) & \(0.25\) & \(8.4681\) & \(2.91\) \\
\(2\) & \(0.25\) & \(3.6481\) & \(1.91\) \\
\(3\) & \(0.1\) & \(0.8281\) & \(0.91\) \\
\(4\) & \(0.05\) & \(0.0081\) & \(0.09\) \\
\(5\) & \(0.05\) & \(1.1881\) & \(1.09\) \\
\(6\) & \(0.05\) & \(4.3681\) & \(2.09\) \\
\(7\) & \(0.15\) & \(9.5481\) & \(3.09\) \\
\(8\) & \(0.05\) & \(16.7281\) & \(4.09\) \\
\(9\) & \(0.04\) & \(25.9081\) & \(5.09\) \\
\(10\) & \(0.005\) & \(37.0881\) & \(6.09\) \\
\(50\) & \(0.005\) & \(2124.2881\) & \(46.09\) \\
\end{longtable}

With this table we can compute both the variance and mean absolute
deviation by taking the second column times by the third, and adding up
those results (for the variance) and the second column times the fourth,
and adding up those results (for the MAD). Doing so results in
\(\text{var}(Y) = 17.5019\) and \(\text{MAD}(Y) = 2.592\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Standard Deviation}\label{standard-deviation}

The higher that an individual random variable's variance is, the more
spread we expect there to be in repeated realizations of that quantity.
Specifically, the more spread out around the mean value the random
variable will be. A random variable with a low variance will concentrate
more around its mean value than one with a higher variance. One
confusing part of the variance of a random variable is in trying to
assess the units. Suppose that a random quantity is measured in a
particular set of units -- dollars, seconds, grams, or similar. In this
case, our interpretations of measures of location will all be in the
same units, which aids in drawing connections to the underlying
phenomenon that we are trying to study. However, because the variance is
squared, we cannot make the same extensions to it. Variance is not
measured in the regular units, but in the regular units, \emph{squared}.

Suppose you have a random time being measured, perhaps the reaction time
for some treatment to take effect in a treated patient. Finding the mean
or median will give you a result that you can read off in seconds. The
range and interquartile range both give you the spread in seconds.
However, if you work out the variance of this quantity it will be
measured in seconds squared -- a unit that is challenging to have much
intuition about. To remedy this we will often use a transformed version
of the variance, called the \textbf{standard deviation}, returning the
units to be only the original scale.

\begin{definition}[]\protect\hypertarget{def-sd}{}\label{def-sd}

The standard deviation of a random variable is the square root of the
variance, which is to say \[\text{SD}(X) = \sqrt{\text{var}(X)}.\]

\end{definition}

We do not often consider computing the standard deviation directly, and
so will most commonly refer to the variance when discussing the
behaviour of a random variable, but it is important to be able to move
seamlessly between these two measures of spread.

\begin{example}[Variation in the Number of Ice Cream Flavours Ordered,
the Finale]\protect\hypertarget{exm-sd}{}\label{exm-sd}

Having realized that the IQR and range are not directly comparable to
the variance, as they are measured in different units, Charles and Sadie
decide to end their investigation in the variability of the number of
ice cream flavours ordered by calculating the standard deviation of
\(Y\). Recall that the probability mass function for \(Y\), the number
of ice cream flavours ordered by a customer, is given by \[
p_Y(y) = \begin{cases} 
0.25 & y = 1 \\
0.25 & y = 2 \\
0.1 & y = 3 \\
0.05 & y = 4 \\
0.05 & y = 5 \\
0.05 & y = 6 \\
0.15 & y = 7 \\
0.05 & y = 8 \\
0.04 & y = 9 \\
0.005 & y = 10 \\ 
0.005 & y = 50 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}.
\]

What is the standard deviation of this random variable?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

The standard deviation is given by the square root of the variance. This
is given by \(\sqrt{17.5019} = 4.18353\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[The Dolphin
Olympics]\protect\hypertarget{exm-dolphin-olympics}{}\label{exm-dolphin-olympics}

Sadie and Charles, on a trip to a beach in a particularly quirky town,
find themselves watching the \textbf{dolphin Olympics}. These are a set
of games put on by the local dolphin populations where they see how high
they can jump from the water, and how many flips they can do while they
do it. Charles and Sadie get to work determining the probability
distributions related to the heights and the number of flips, with Sadie
taking the heights and Charles taking the number of flips. At the end of
the day they are discussing their findings and Sadie indicates that the
standard deviation of the height that was jumped was \(1.6m\). Charles
is intrigued, saying, ``I could have sworn that there was more variation
in the jump heights than in the number of flips, but the variance of the
flips was \(2.56\), greater than the variability in the heights!''

Is Charles correct? Why or why not?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Charles has compared the standard deviation of the first quantity to the
variance of the second. We must compare the same measure, and as a
result, conclude that the variance of the heights was \(1.6^2 = 2.56\),
exactly the same as the second.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Computing the Variance}\label{computing-the-variance}

When computing the variance of a random quantity, we often use a
shortcut for the formula, \[\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.\]
Generally, this is moderately more straightforward to calculate since
\(X^2\) is an easier transformation than \((X-E[X])^2\). This identity
will come back time and time again, with a lot of versatility in the
ways that it can be used. Typically, when a variance is needed to be
calculated the process is to simply compute \(E[X]\) and \(E[X^2]\), and
then apply this relationship.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Proof of the Variance Identity}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

To determine the variance identity, we need only remember the definition
of the variance (being \(E[(X-E[X])^2]\)), and then use summation
techniques to manipulate the expression. To this end consider,
\begin{align*}
\text{var}(X) &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} (x-E[X])^2p_X(x) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} (x^2 - 2xE[X] + E[X]^2)p_X(x) \\
&=\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} x^2p_X(x) - 2E[X]\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + E[X^2]\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_X(x)\\
&= E[X^2] - 2E[X]E[X] + E[X]^2\\
&= E[X^2] - E[X]^2.
\end{align*}

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{example}[Choosing the Outcome of a
Die]\protect\hypertarget{exm-var-calc}{}\label{exm-var-calc}

Charles and Sadie come across a new game of chance involving the rolling
of a die. In it a player chooses a number between \(1\) and \(6\). They
then roll a die (up to) \(6\) times. If they get their chosen number on
the first throw for the first time, they get \(\$1\). If they get their
chosen number on the second throw, they get \(\$2\). The same goes for
the first time seeing their chosen number from throws \(3\) through
\(6\). If they never get the chosen number, they have to pay \(\$1\).

What is the expected value and variance of a player playing this game?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Let \(X\) represent the winnings of a play of this game. We know that
\(X\) takes a value in \(\{-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). The \(p_X(-1)\) is
given by the probability that the die never shows the chosen number. We
can view this as \(6\) independent trials, where each trial is the
result of a die roll. If \(A_j\) is the event that the die shows the
selected number, then we can calculate
\(P(A_1^C, A_2^C, A_3^C, A_4^C, A_5^C, A_6^C) = P(A_1^C)P(A_2^C)P(A_3^C)P(A_4^C)P(A_5^C)P(A_6^C)\).
Note that each of these probabilities is equivalent, and equivalently
equal to \(\dfrac{5}{6}\), and so this probability is
\(\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^6 \approx 0.335\). The remainder of the
outcomes happen if the first time that the number shows up is on toss
\(j\). This means that we have \(A_1, \dots, A_{j-1}^C\) and then
\(A_j\) occurring. As a result, for \(j=1,\dots,6\) we get
\(P(A_1^C, \dots, A_{j-1}^C, A_j) = P(A_1^C)^{j-1}P(A_j)\). Note that
\(P(A_j) = \dfrac{1}{6}\), no matter \(j\), and so the total probability
here is \(\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^{j-1}\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)\).
This fully defines the probability mass function.

To get the \(E[X]\) we can apply the standard expectation formula. To
get the variance we can note that \(\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2\),
and so while we compute \(E[X]\) we can also compute \(E[X^2]\). To this
end
\[E[X] = (-1)\left(\frac{5}{5}\right)^6 + \frac{1}{6}\left[1 + 2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) + 3\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2} + 4\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{3} + 5\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}+ 6\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5}\right].\]
Solving this gives approximately \(\$0.98\), so every play of the game
you would expect to earn \(98\) cents, approximately. To find
\(E[X^2]\), we use essentially the same setup, this time squaring the
values,
\[E[X] = (-1)^2\left(\frac{5}{5}\right)^6 + \frac{1}{6}\left[1^2 + 2^2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) + 3^2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2} + 4^2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{3} + 5^2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}+ 6^2\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5}\right].\]
This is \(8.728\), approximately. Then the variance will be given by
\[\text{var}(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \approx 8.728 - (0.98)^2 = 7.7676.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{The Variance of
Transformations}\label{the-variance-of-transformations}

With expectations, we saw that \(E[g(X)]\) needed to be directly
computed from the definition. The same is true for variances of
transformations. Specifically, \(\text{var}(g(X))\) is given by
\(E[(g(X) - E[g(X)])^2]\) which can be simplified with the previous
relationship as \(E[g(X)^2] - E[g(X)]^2\). Just as with expectations, it
is important to realize that \(\text{var}(g(X)) \neq g(\text{var}(X))\),
and so dealing with transformations requires further work.

With expectations, we highlighted linear transformations as a special
case, with \(g(X) = aX + b\). For the variance, the linear
transformations are also worth distinguishing from others. In
particular, \[\text{var}(aX + b) = a^2\text{var}(X).\] In the same way
that the linearity of expectation demonstrates that the expected value
of any constant is that constant, we can use this identity to show that
the variance of constant is zero. However, we can also reason to this
based on our definitions so far. Suppose that we have a random variable
which is constant.\footnote{This seems to be an oxymoron, but it is
  perfectly well defined.} A constant \(b\) can be seen as a random
variable with probability distribution \(p_X(x) = 1\) if \(x=b\) and
\(p_X(x) = 0\) otherwise. The expected value is going to be
\(E[X] = 1(b) = b\), and \(E[X^2] = 1(b)^2 = b^2\). Thus,
\(\text{var}(b) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = b^2 - b^2 = 0\). From an intuitive
perspective, there is no variation around the mean of a constant. It is
always the same value. As a result, when taking the variance, we know
that it should be \(0\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Proof of the Variance of Linear Transformations}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

To calculate the variance of a linear transformation of a random
variable we can apply the standard identity for the variance, giving
\begin{align*}
E[(aX+b)^2] &= E[a^2X^2 + 2abX + b^2] \\
&= E[a^2X^2] + E[2abX] + E[b^2]\\
&= a^2E[X^2] + 2abE[X] + b^2.
\end{align*} Next, we note that \(E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b\) and so
\begin{align*}
E[aX + b]^2 &= (aE[X] + b)^2 \\
&= a^2E[X]^2 + 2abE[X] + b^2.\end{align*} Differencing these two
quantities gives
\[a^2E[X^2] + 2abE[X] + b^2 - a^2E[X]^2 - 2abE[X] - b^2 = a^2(E[X^2] - E[X]^2).\]
By noting that \(E[X^2] - E[X]^2\), we can complete the statement that
\[\text{var}(aX + b) = a^2\text{var}(X).\]

\end{tcolorbox}

Thus, when applying a linear transformation, only the multiplicative
constant matters, and it transforms the variance by a squared factor.
This should make some intuitive sense that the additive constant does
not change anything. If we consider that variance is a measure of
spread, adding a constant value to our random quantity will not make it
more or less spread out, it will simply shift where the spread is
located. This is not true of the mean, which measures where the center
of the distribution is, which helps explain why the result identities
are different.

\begin{example}[Sadie's Trip to
America]\protect\hypertarget{exm-var-linear-transformation}{}\label{exm-var-linear-transformation}

When Sadie had recently returned from a long trip to America, Charles
and Sadie worked out how to convert the expected values of temperatures
from Celsius to Fahrenheit. They now wish to do the same, with the
variances. The distribution of daily temperatures, in Celsius, is
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    0.1 & x \in \{10, 11, 12, 13, 14\} \\
    0.05 & x \in \{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  What is the variance of temperatures, in Celsius?
\item
  Supposing that the temperature in Fahrenheit is given by
  \(Y = 1.8X + 32\), what is the variance of temperatures in Fahrenheit?

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Here we find \begin{align*}
   E[X] = \sum_{x=10}^{24} xp_X(x) &= 0.1\sum_{x=10}^{14}x + 0.05\sum_{x=15}^{24}x \\
   &= 15.75. \\
   E[X^2] = \sum_{x=10}^{24} x^2p_X(x) &= 0.1\sum_{x=10}^{14}x^2 + 0.05\sum_{x=15}^{24}x^2 \\
   &= 267.25 \\
   \text{var}(X) &= 267.25 - 15.75^2 \\
   &= 19.1875.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Since \(\text{var}(X) = 19.1875\), then we know that
  \(\text{var}(Y) = \text{var}(1.8X + 32) = 1.8^2\text{var}(X) = 62.1675\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Unlike the expectation, the variance of additive terms will not
generally be the addition of the variances themselves. That is, we
cannot say that
\(\text{var}(g(X) + h(X)) = \text{var}(g(X)) + \text{var}(h(X))\).
Writing out the definition shows issue with this,
\[E[(g(X) + h(X))^2] = E[g(X)^2] + 2E[g(X)h(X)] + E[h(X)^2].\] The first
and third terms here are nicely separated and behave well. However, the
central term is not generally easy to simplify. You can view
\(g(X)h(X)\) as a function itself, and so
\[E[g(X)h(X)] \neq E[g(X)]E[h(X)].\] Instead, this will typically need
to be worked out for any specific set of functions.

\chapter{Expectations and Variances with Multiple Random
Variables}\label{expectations-and-variances-with-multiple-random-variables}

\section{Conditional Expectation}\label{conditional-expectation}

Up until this point we have considered the marginal probability
distribution when exploring the measures of central tendency and spread.
These help to summarize the marginal behaviour of a random quantity,
capturing the distribution of \(X\) alone. When introducing
distributions, we also made a point to introduce the conditional
distribution as one which is particularly relevant when there is extra
information. The question ``what do we expect to happen, given that we
have an additional piece of information?'' is not only well-defined, but
it is an incredibly common type of question to ask.\footnote{For
  instance, you might ask ``how long do we expect a patient to live,
  given that they received a particular treatment?'' or ``how much do we
  expect this house to sell for, given it has a certain square
  footage?'' or ``how many goals do we expect this hockey team to score,
  given their current lineup?'' A large number of questions which we may
  hope to answer using data can be framed as a question of conditional
  expectation.} To answer it, we require \textbf{conditional
expectations}.

\begin{definition}[]\protect\hypertarget{def-conditional-expectation}{}\label{def-conditional-expectation}

The conditional expectation of a random variable, \(X\), given a second
random variable, \(Y\), is the average value of \(X\) when we know the
value of \(Y\). Specifically, we write \(E[X|Y]\), and define this to be
\[E[X|Y] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} xp_{X|Y}(x|y),\] which is exactly
analogous to the defining relationship for \(E[X]\), replacing the
marginal probability mass function with the conditional probability mass
function.

\end{definition}

In principle, a conditional expectation is no more challenging to
calculate than a marginal expectation. Suppose we want to know the
expected value of \(X\) assuming that we know that a second random
quantity, \(Y\) has taken on the value \(y\). We write this as
\(E[X|Y=y]\), and we replace \(p_X(x)\) with \(p_{X|Y}(x|y)\) in the
defining relationship. That is
\[E[X|Y=y] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_{X|Y}(x|y).\] We can think of the
conditional distribution of \(X|Y=y\) as simply being a distribution
itself, and then work with that no differently. The conditional
variance, which we denote \(\text{var}(X|Y=y)\) is defined in an exactly
analogous manner, giving \[\text{var}(X|Y) = E[(X - E[X|Y])^2|Y].\]

Above we supposed that we knew that \(Y=y\). However, sometimes we want
to work with the conditional distribution more generally. That is, we
want to investigate the behaviour of \(X|Y\), without yet knowing what
\(Y\) equals. We can use the same procedure as above, however, this time
we leave \(Y\) unspecified. We denote this as \(E[X|Y]\), and this
expression will be a function of \(Y\). Then, whenever a value for \(Y\)
is observed, we can specify \(Y=y\), deriving the specific value. We
will typically compute \(E[X|Y]\) rather than \(E[X|Y=y]\), since once
we have \(E[X|Y]\) we can easily find \(E[X|Y=y]\) for \emph{every}
value of \(y\).

\begin{example}[Charles Commences
Crocheting]\protect\hypertarget{exm-conditional-expectation}{}\label{exm-conditional-expectation}

Charles has recently taking up crocheting, but as it is a new skill, is
still in the phase of learning where mistakes are somewhat common. When
sitting down to practice, the number of rows that Charles can complete
in an hour is being recorded by Sadie, as a random quantity \(X\). After
these have been completed, Charles goes back through and counts the
number of mistakes that were made, recording this as \(Y\). In their
experiments they find that
\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{44800}{854769} \frac{1}{(x-y)!y!} \left(\frac{21}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{y}, \]
for \(x \in \{1,2,3,\dots,10\}\) and \(y \in\{0,1,2,\dots,y\}\). Sadie
works out that
\[p_X(x) = \frac{44800}{854769} \frac{3^x}{x!}, \quad x\in\{1,2,3,\dots,10\}.\]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sadie could have used the process of marginalization. That is,
  \[p_X(x) = \sum_{y = 0}^{x} p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \sum_{y=0}^{x} \frac{44800}{854769} \frac{1}{(x-y)!y!} \left(\frac{21}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{y}.\]
\item
  We want \(E[Y|X=3]\). For this, we can use \(p_{Y|X}(y|3)\) as the
  distribution, which is expressible as
  \[p_{Y|X}(y|3) = \frac{\frac{44800}{854769} \frac{1}{(3-y)!y!} \left(\frac{21}{10}\right)^3\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{y}}{\frac{44800}{854769} \frac{3^{3}}{(3)!}} = \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{y}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y,\]
  where \(y \in \{0,1,2,3\}\). Then, \begin{align*}
   E[Y|X=3] &= \sum_{y=0}^3 y\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{y}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y \\
   &= (1)\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^1 + (2)\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{2}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^2 + (3)\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{3}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^3 \\
   &= \frac{9}{10} = 0.9.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Following the same process as above, we first get that the general
  conditional distribution is given by
  \[p_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{\frac{44800}{854769} \frac{1}{(x-y)!y!} \left(\frac{21}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{y}}{\frac{44800}{854769} \frac{3^{x}}{(x)!}} = \binom{x}{y}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y,\]
  for \(y\in\{0,\dots,x\}\). Then the expected value of \(E[Y|X]\) can
  be found as \begin{align*}
  E[Y|X] &= \sum_{y=0}^x y\binom{x}{y}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y.
  \end{align*}
\item
  We have \begin{align*}
  E[Y|X] &= \sum_{y=0}^x y\binom{x}{y}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y \\
  &= \sum_{y=1}^x y\binom{x}{y}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y \\
  &= \sum_{y=1}^x x\binom{x-1}{y-1}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y \\
  &= \frac{3x}{10}\sum_{y=1}^x \binom{x-1}{y-1}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^{x-1}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{y-1} \\
  &= \frac{3x}{10}\sum_{k=0}^{r} \binom{r}{k}\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^r\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{k} \\
  &= \frac{3x}{10}\sum_{k=0}^{r} p_{Y|X}(k|r) \\
  &= \frac{3x}{10}.
  \end{align*}
\item
  We have seen that \(E[Y|X=3] = 0.9\). As a result, using the
  previously derived conditional probability distribution,
  \begin{align*}
   \text{var}(Y|X=3) &= \sum_{y=0}^3 (y-0.9)^2\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{y}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^y \\
   &= 0.9^2\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{0}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^0 + (0.1)^2\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^1 \\
   &\quad + (1.1)^2\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{2}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^2 + (2.1)^2\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^3\binom{3}{3}\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^3 \\
   &= 0.63
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conditional Expectations as Random
Variables}\label{conditional-expectations-as-random-variables}

Since \(E[X|Y]\) is a function of an unknown random quantity, \(Y\),
\(E[X|Y]\) is also a random variable.\footnote{It is useful to keep in
  mind that anytime we do \emph{anything} with a random variable,
  mathematically, we produce an additional random variable. If we think
  of a random variable as being some mathematical variable whose value
  depends on the results of an experiment, then if we take that value
  and apply a function to it we have a \emph{new} value whose results
  also depend on the results of an experiment.} It is a transformation
of \(Y\), and as such, it will have some distribution, some expectation,
and some variance itself. This is often a confusing concept when it is
first introduced, so to recap:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(X\) and \(Y\) are both random variables;
\item
  \(E[X]\) and \(E[Y]\) are both constant, numerical values describing
  the distribution of \(X\) and \(Y\);
\item
  \(E[X|Y=y]\) and \(E[Y|X=x]\) are each numeric constants which
  summarize the distribution of \(X|Y=y\) and \(Y|X=x\) respectively;
\item
  \(E[X|Y]\) and \(E[Y|X]\) are functions of \(Y\) and \(X\),
  respectively, and can as such be seen as transformations of (and
  random quantities depending on) \(Y\) and \(X\) respectively.
\end{itemize}

We do not often think of the distribution of \(E[X|Y]\) directly,
however, there are very useful results regarding its expected value and
its variance, which will commonly be exploited. If we take the expected
value of \(E[X|Y]\) we will find that \(E[E[X|Y]] = E[X]\). Note that
since \(E[X|Y] = g(Y)\) for some transformation, \(g\), the outer
expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of \(Y\).
Sometimes when this may get confusing we will use notation to emphasize
this fact, specifically, \(E_Y[E_{X|Y}[X|Y]] = E_X[X]\). This notation
is not necessary, but it can clarify when there is much going on, and is
a useful technique to fallback on.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Law of Total Expectation}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

For any random quantities, \(X\) and \(Y\), the Law of Total Expectation
states that \[E[X] = E[E[X|Y]].\] That is, if we first compute the
conditional expectation of \(X\) given \(Y\), then take the expected
value of this quantity, we compute \(E[X]\).

\end{tcolorbox}

In the same way that it is sometimes easier to first condition on \(Y\)
in order to compute the marginal distribution of \(X\) via applications
of the law of total probability, so too can it be easier to first work
out conditional expectations, and then take the expected value of the
resulting expression.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Proof of the Law of Total Expectation}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

To prove that law of total expectation, we note that \(E[X|Y]\) is a
random function of \(Y\). As a result, we can apply the LOTUS to
\(E[X|Y]\) as a function of \(Y\) when we take \(E[E[X|Y]]\). Doing so
yields, \begin{align*}
E_Y[E[X|Y]] &= \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} E[X|Y]p_Y(y) \\
&= \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}\left(\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_{X|Y}(x|Y)\right)p_Y(y) \\
&= \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}x\frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}p_Y(y)\\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}xp_{X,Y}(x,y)\\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} xp_X(x)\\
&= E[X].\end{align*} The remainder of the proof, following an
application of the LOTUS relies upon manipulating summations.

\end{tcolorbox}

Mistakes]\protect\hypertarget{exm-law-of-total-expectation}{}\label{exm-law-of-total-expectation}

While Charles came to understand the expected number of mistakes being
made given a certain number of crochet lines being complete, it is
easier for Charles to consider this on the basis of hourly errors than
conditional hourly errors. Knowing that
\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{44800}{854769} \frac{1}{(x-y)!y!} \left(\frac{21}{10}\right)^x\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^{y}, \]
for \(x \in \{1,2,3,\dots,10\}\) and \(y \in\{0,1,2,\dots,y\}\), that
\[p_X(x) = \frac{44800}{854769} \frac{3^x}{x!}, \quad x\in\{1,2,3,\dots,10\},\]
and that \(E[Y|X] = \frac{3X}{10}\), what is \(E[Y]\)?

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Here we can apply the law of total expectation. We have that
\(E[Y] = E[E[Y|X]] = E\left[\frac{3X}{10}\right] = \frac{3}{10}E[X]\).
Thus, we need to work out \(E[X]\), which can be done via the
probability mass function of \(X\). Specifically, \begin{align*}
E[X] &= \sum_{x=1}^{10} x\frac{44800}{854769} \frac{3^x}{x!} \\
&= frac{44800}{854769} \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{3^x}{(x-1)!} \\
&= frac{44800}{854769}\times\frac{67413}{1120} \\
&= \frac{898840}{284923} \approx 3.155. 
\end{align*} Thus, in total, the expected value of \(Y\) will be
\[\frac{3}{10}\times\frac{898840}{284923} = \frac{269652}{284923} \approx 0.946\].

\section{Conditional Variance}\label{conditional-variance}

While the conditional expectation is used often, the conditional
variance is less central to the study of random variables. As discussed,
briefly, the conditional variance is given by the same variance
relationship, replacing the marginal probability distribution with the
conditional one. Just as with expectations \(\text{var}(X|Y=y)\) is a
numeric quantity given by \(E[(X-E[X|Y=y])^2|Y=y]\) and
\(\text{var}(X|Y)\) is a random variable given by \(E[(X-E[X|Y])^2|Y]\).
This means that we can consider the distribution, and critically the
expected value of, \(\text{var}(X|Y)\). A core result relating to
conditional expectations and variances connects these concepts.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Law of Total Variance}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

For any random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), we can write
\[\text{var}(X) = E[\text{var}(X|Y)] + \text{var}(E[X|Y]).\] This result
can be viewed as decomposing the variance of a random quantity into two
separate components, and comes up again in later statistics courses. At
this point we can view this as a method for connecting the marginal
distribution through the conditional variance nad expectation.

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{example}[Charles' Crochet
Consistency]\protect\hypertarget{exm-law-of-total-variance}{}\label{exm-law-of-total-variance}

Charles understands that the number of mistakes made per hour (\(Y\))
given the number of rows crocheted per hour (\(X\)) has
\(E[Y|X] = 0.3X\). Moreover, the variability in this estimate is given
by \(\text{var}(Y|X) = 0.21X\). Sadie has worked hard to find out that
\[E[X] = \frac{898840}{284923} \quad\text{ and }\quad \text{var}(X) = \frac{214410323010}{81181115929}.\]
Can Charles use this information to understand \(\text{var}(Y)\)?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We can apply the law of total variance. Specifically,
\[\text{var}(Y) = E[\text{var}(Y|X)] + \text{var}(E[Y|X]) = E[0.21X] + \text{var}(0.3X) = 0.21E[X] + 0.09\text{var}(X).\]
Plugging in the marginal values gives
\[\text{var}(Y) = 0.21\frac{898840}{284923} + 0.09\frac{214410323010}{81181115929} = \frac{730779688281}{811811159290} \approx 0.90.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Joint Expectations}\label{joint-expectations}

The final set of techniques to consider\footnote{At least, for now.}
relate to making use of the joint distribution between \(X\) and \(Y\).
Specifically, if we have any function of two random variables, say
\(g(X,Y)\) and we wish to find \(E[g(X,Y)]\). This follows in an exactly
analogous derivation to what we have seen so far. In this case, we
replace the marginal distribution with the joint distribution. The
variance extends in the same manner as well.

\begin{definition}[Joint
Expectation]\protect\hypertarget{def-joint-expectation}{}\label{def-joint-expectation}

The joint expectation of a function (\(g\)) of two random variables,
\(X\) and \(Y\), is written \(E[g(X,Y)]\). This is an expectation
computed with respect to the joint distribution of \(X\) and \(Y\),
giving
\[E[g(X,Y)] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}g(x,y)p_{X,Y}(x,y).\]
The joint expectation captures the location of a multivariate function,
and is readily extended to more than two random variables.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Joint
Variance]\protect\hypertarget{def-joint-variance}{}\label{def-joint-variance}

The joint variance of a function (\(g\)) of two random variables, \(X\)
and \(Y\), is written \(\text{var}(g(X,Y))\). This is a variance
computed with respect to the joint distribution of \(X\) and \(Y\),
giving \[\text{var}(g(X,Y)) = E[(g(X,Y) - E[g(X,Y)])^2].\] The joint
variance captures the spread of a multivariate function, and is readily
extended to more than two random variables.

\end{definition}

For instance, if we want to consider the product of two random
variables, we could use this technique to determine \(E[XY]\) and
\(\text{var}(XY)\).

\begin{example}[Door-to-Door Charity Chocolate
Bars]\protect\hypertarget{exm-joint-expectation}{}\label{exm-joint-expectation}

Charles and Sadie are helping to raise money for a local charity, and to
do so, they are going around house-to-house to sell chocolate bars. As
they walk between the homes, they realize that depending on where in the
city they are, the number of houses that they visit in a day is going to
be vary. Moreover, each time they stop by a house, whether or not they
will make a sale is uncertain. If, in any given hour, they take \(Y\) to
be the number of houses that they visit, and \(X\) to be the number of
chocolate bars that they sell, then they work out that the joint
probability mass function of \(X\) and \(Y\) is given by
\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{2y - 1}{36(y + 1)}, \quad y\in\{1,\dots,6\}, x\in\{0,\dots,y\}.\]

What is the expected number of chocolate bars per house that the visit?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We want \(E[g(X,Y)]\) where \(g(X,Y) = \dfrac{X}{Y}\). Thus, using the
defining relationship for joint probabilities we get \begin{align*}
E[g(X,Y)] &= E\left[\frac{X}{Y}\right] \\
&= \sum_{y=1}^{6}\sum_{x=0}^{y} \frac{x}{y}\cdot\frac{2y - 1}{36(y + 1)} \\
&= \sum_{y=1}^{6}\frac{2y-1}{36y(y + 1)}\sum_{x=0}^{y} x \\
&= \sum_{y=1}^{6}\frac{2y-1}{36y(y + 1)}\cdot\frac{y(y+1)}{2} \\
&= \sum_{y=1}^{6}\frac{2y-1}{72} \\
&= \frac{1}{72}\left[2\sum_{y=1}^{6} y - \sum_{y=1}^6 1\right]\\
&= \frac{1}{72}\left[42 - 6\right] = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*} As a result, they sell \(0.5\) chocolate bars per house
that they visit, on average.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

It is worth considering, briefly, the ways in which conditional and
joint expectations interact. Namely, if we know that \(Y=y\), then the
transformation \(g(X,y)\) only has one random component, which is \(X\).
As a result, taking \(E[g(X,Y)|Y=y] = E[g(X,y)|Y=y]\). If instead we use
the conditional distribution without a specific value, we still have
that \(Y\) is fixed within the expression, it is just fixed to an
unknown quantity. That is \(E[g(X,Y)|Y]\) will be a function of \(Y\).
We saw before that \(E[E[X|Y]] = E[X]\), and the same is true in the
joint case. Thus, one technique for computing the joint expectation,
\(g(X,Y)\) is to first compute the conditional expectation, and then
compute the marginal expectation of the resulting quantity.

\begin{example}[Door-to-Door Charity Chocolate Bars, Marginally
Easier]\protect\hypertarget{exm-joint-expectation-two}{}\label{exm-joint-expectation-two}

While walking around selling chocolate bars for charity, Charles and
Sadie realize that it is fairly straightforward\footnote{Comparatively
  speaking!} to marginalize the joint probability mass function for the
number of houses that they visit and the number of chocolate bars that
they sell, since \(X\) does not actually appear in the equation. That
is, when
\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{2y - 1}{36(y + 1)}, \quad y\in\{1,\dots,6\}, x\in\{0,\dots,y\},\]
taking the sum
\(\sum_{x=0}^{y} p_{X,Y}(x,y) = (y+1)p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \dfrac{2y-1}{36}\).
This gives the marginal probability distribution of \(Y\). They also
realize that this has greatly simplified finding the conditional
probability distribution of \(X\) given \(Y\).

\item
  Note that,
  \[E\left[\frac{Y}{X}\right] = E\left[E\left[\left.\frac{Y}{X}\right|Y\right]\right] = E[0.5] = 0.5,\]
  just as before.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Linear Combinations of Random
Variables}\label{linear-combinations-of-random-variables}

With this relationship, we can ask about taking combinations of random
variables. For instance, if we have two random variables \(X\) and
\(Y\), we can use this framework to understand how \(X + Y\) behaves. An
application of these rules with the function \(g(X,Y) = X + Y\) gives
\(E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]\), and that
\(\text{var}(X + Y) = \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) + 2E[(X-E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\).
Thus, we see that expectations are linear over combinations of random
variables, however, variances are not. The term
\(E[(X-E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\) is called the \textbf{covariance} of \(X\) and
\(Y\), and it is a measure of how related \(X\) and \(Y\) happen to be.

\begin{definition}[Covariance]\protect\hypertarget{def-covariance}{}\label{def-covariance}

The covariance of two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), is given by
\(\text{cov}(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\). The covariance measures
the relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\), where a positive covariance
value means that as \(X\) increases, \(Y\) will also increase on average
(and vice versa). A negative covariance means that as \(X\) increases,
\(Y\) will decrease on average (and vice versa).

\end{definition}

The covariance behaves similarly to the variance. We can see directly
from the definition that \(\text{cov}(X,X) = \text{var}(X)\). Moreover,
using similar arguments to those used for the variance, we can show that
\[\text{cov}(aX+b,cY+d) = ac\text{cov}(X,Y).\] Covariances remain
linear, so that
\begin{multline*}\text{cov}(X+Y,X+Y+Z)=\text{cov}(X,X)+\text{cov}(X,Y)+\text{cov}(X,Z)\\ +\text{cov}(Y,X)+\text{cov}(Y,Y)+\text{cov}(Y,Z).\end{multline*}
These make covariances somewhat nicer to deal with than variances, and
on occasion it may be easier to think of variances as covariances with
themselves.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Proofs for the Expectation and Variance of Linear Combinations of Random
Variables}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

With \(g(X,Y) = X+Y\), we can consider applying the defining
relationship for joint expectations. That is \begin{align*}
E[X+Y] &= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}(x+y)p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}x\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}p_{X,Y}(x,y) + \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}y\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}xp_X(x) + \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}yp_Y(y) \\
&= E[X] + E[Y].\end{align*}

For the variances, we apply the variance relationship, giving
\begin{align*}
E[(X+Y-E[X]-E[Y])^2] &= E[((X-E[X])+(Y-E[Y]))^2] \\
&= E[(X-E[X])^2] + E[(Y-E[Y])^2] \\
&\quad+ 2E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] \\
&= \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) + 2E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])].\end{align*}
Rewriting the covariance in more common terms gives,
\[\text{var}(X+Y) = \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) + 2\text{cov}(X,Y).\]

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie's Orchard
Trip]\protect\hypertarget{exm-linear-combination-of-RV}{}\label{exm-linear-combination-of-RV}

Charles and Sadie adore visiting orchards when the season is right. They
are happy to go pick fruit, and then combine everything that they manage
together at the end. On one trip to a favourite orchard of theirs they
decide to split up and pick separately. This works well enough that on
the trip home they decide to start analyzing this behaviour. They take
\(X\) to be the quantity of fruit picked by Sadie, and \(Y\) to be the
quantity of fruit picked by Charles. Suppose that they figure that the
number of kilograms of fruit jointly picked by them is represented by
the probability mass function
\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{14xy}{251(x + y)}, \quad x,y\in\{1,\dots,4\}.\]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that the joint distribution is symmetric in \(X\) and \(Y\) so
  they will have equal expected value. We solve for \(E[X]\) and note
  that \(E[Y]\) will be the same. \begin{align*}
  E[X] &= \sum_{x=1}^4 xp_X(x) \\
  &= \sum_{x=1}^4 x\sum_{y=1}^4 p_{X,Y}(x, y) \\
  &= \sum_{x=1}^4\sum_{y=1}^4 \frac{14x^2y}{251(x + y)} \\
  &= \frac{700}{251} \approx 2.789.
  \end{align*}
\item
  For the variance we note that they will also be equivalent between the
  two individuals. Since we have \(E[X]\) already, we simply compute
  \(E[X^2]\) which is given by \begin{align*}
  E[X^2] &= \sum_{x=1}^4 x^2p_X(x) \\
  &= \sum_{x=1}^4 x^2\sum_{y=1}^4 p_{X,Y}(x, y) \\
  &= \sum_{x=1}^4\sum_{y=1}^4 \frac{14x^3y}{251(x + y)} \\
  &= \frac{11169}{1255} \approx 8.900.
  \end{align*} Thus, the variance is going to be given by
  \[\text{var}(X) = \frac{11169}{1255} - \left(\frac{700}{251}\right)^2 = \frac{353419}{315005}.\]
\item
  The covariance is computable using the joint distribution directly,
  giving \begin{align*}
  \text{cov}(X,Y) &= E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] \\
  &= \sum_{x=1}^4\sum_{y=1}^4 \left(X-\frac{700}{251}\right)\left(Y-\frac{700}{251}\right)\frac{14xy}{251(x + y)} \\
  &= \frac{17581}{315005} \approx 0.059
  \end{align*}
\item
  We want \(E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y] = \frac{1400}{251}\). This could also
  be computed directly, \begin{align*}
  E[X+Y] &= \sum_{x=1}^4\sum_{y=1}^4 (x+y)\frac{14xy}{251(x + y)} \\
  &= \frac{14}{251}\sum_{x=1}^4\sum_{y=1}^{4}xy \\
  &= \frac{14}{251}\times 100 = \frac{1400}{251}.
  \end{align*}
\item
  We want
  \[\text{var}(X+Y) = \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) + 2\text{cov}(X,Y) = 2\times\frac{353419}{315005} + 2\times\frac{17581}{315005} = \frac{148400}{63001}.\]

\section{Expectations when Random Variables are
Independent}\label{expectations-when-random-variables-are-independent}

Whenever we can assume independence of random quantities, we can greatly
simplify the expressions we are dealing with. Recall that the key
defining relationship with independence is that
\(p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x)p_Y(y)\). Suppose then that we can write
\(g(X,Y) = g_X(X)h_Y(Y)\). For instance, for the covariance we have
\(g(X,Y)=(x-E[X])(Y-E[Y])\) and so \(g_X(X) = X-E[X]\) and
\(h_Y(Y) = Y-E[Y]\). If we want to compute \(E[g(X,Y)]\) then we get
\begin{align*}
E[g(X,Y)] &= E[g_X(X)h_Y(Y)] \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}g_X(x)h_Y(y)p_{X,Y}(x,y) \\
&= \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}g_X(x)h_Y(y)p_X(x)p_Y(y) \\
&=\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}g_X(x)p_X(x)\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}h_Y(y)p_Y(y)\\
&= E[g_X(X)]E[h_Y(Y)].\end{align*} Thus, whenever random variables are
independent, we have the ability to separate them over their
expectations. Stated succinctly, whenever \(X\perp Y\), then
\[E[g_X(X)h_Y(Y)] = E[g_X(X)]E[h_Y(Y)].\]

\begin{example}[Sadie and Charles Turn back To
Dice]\protect\hypertarget{exm-independent-rv-expectation}{}\label{exm-independent-rv-expectation}

With a more thorough understanding of joint distributions, Sadie and
Charles turn back to games of chance. They are considering games where

\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  We know that \(X_1\) takes on the values in \(\{1,\dots,6\}\) with
  equal probability each. Thus we have \begin{align*}
  E[X_1] &= \sum_{x=1}^6 \frac{x}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\
  E[X_1^2] &= \sum_{x=1}^6 \frac{x^2}{6} = \frac{91}{6} \\
  \text{var}(X_1) &= \frac{91}{6} - \left(\frac{21}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{35}{12}.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Note that because \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are independent, we get
  \begin{align*}
   E[X_1 + X_2] &= E[X_1] + E[X_2] \\
   &= 2\frac{21}{6} = 7.\\
   \text{var}(X_1 + X_2) &= \text{var}(X_1) + \text{var}(X_2) \\
   &= 2\frac{35}{12} = \frac{35}{6}.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Note that because \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are independent, we get
  \begin{align*}
   E[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i] &= \sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i]\\
   &= \frac{21n}{6}\\
   \text{var}(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^n\text{var}(X_i)\\
   &= \frac{35n}{12}.
  \end{align*}
\item
  Note that \(Z\) and \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) are all independent. As a result
  if we take \(T = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\), then \(T \perp Z\) and so
  \(E[TZ] = E[T]E[Z]\). Thus, from (a), (b), and (c) we get
  \(E[ZT] = \frac{21}{6}\times\frac{21n}{6} = \frac{49n}{4}\).
\end{enumerate}

For the variance note that we get
\[\text{var}(TZ) = E[(TZ)^2] - E[TZ]^2 = E[T^2]E[Z^2] - E[TZ]^2.\] For
\(E[T^2]\) and \(E[Z^2]\) note that \(E[T^2] = \text{var}(T) + E[T]^2\),
and similarly for \(Z\). Thus
\[E[T^2] = \frac{35n}{12} + \left(\frac{21n}{6}\right)^2,\] and
\[E[Z^2] = \frac{91}{6},\] thus
\[\text{var}(TZ) = \left(\frac{35n}{12} + \left(\frac{21n}{6}\right)^2\right)\left(\frac{91}{6}\right) - \left( \frac{49n}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{245n(21n + 26)}{144}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Consider what this means for the covariance between independent random
variables. If \(X\perp Y\) then
\[\text{cov}(X,Y) = E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] = E[X-E[X]]E[Y-E[Y]].\] Note
that \(E[X - E[X]] = E[X] - E[X] = 0\), and the same for
\(E[Y - E[Y]]\). Thus, if \(X \perp Y\) then \(\text{cov}(X, Y) = 0\).
That is to say, if \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, then
\(\text{cov}(X,Y)=0\). It is critical to note that this relationship
does \textbf{not} go both ways. You are able to have
\(\text{cov}(X,Y) = 0\) even if \(X\not\perp Y\).

While the covariance is interesting in and of itself, the result allows
us to simplify the expression for the variance of a sum of two random
variables. Specifically, for independent random variables \(X\) and
\(Y\) we also must have that
\(\text{var}(X+Y)=\text{var}(X)+\text{var}(Y)\). This further extends to
more than two random variables, where if (for instance) we have
\(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n\) all independent, we get both that
\[E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i],\] and that
\[\text{var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{var}(X_i).\]
These are relationships that we will use \textbf{heavily} once we begin
to consider statistics. Note, this extension to more than two random
variables applies to all of the concepts discussed throughout this
chapter.

In order to do so, the relevant joint distribution, or conditional
distribution would need to be substituted into the definitions. Often
the complexity here becomes a matter of keeping track of which
quantities are random, and which are not. For instance, if we have
\(X,Y,Z\) as random variables, then \(E[X|Y,Z]\) is a random function of
\(Y\) and \(Z\). We will still have that \(E[E[X|Y,Z]] = E[X]\),
however, the outer expectation is now the joint expectation with respect
to \(Y\) and \(Z\). As a result, we can also write \(E[E[X|Y,Z]|Y]\).
The first expectation will be with respect to \(X|Y,Z\), while the outer
expectation is with respect to \(Z|Y\). This is a useful demonstration
for when making the distribution of the expectation explicit may help
clarify what is being computed. In general, the innermost expectations
will always have more conditioning variables than the outer ones. Each
time we step out, we peel back one of hte conditional variables until
the outermost is either a marginal (or joint). This may help to keep
things clear.

\chapter{The Named Discrete
Distributions}\label{the-named-discrete-distributions}

\section{General Named Distributions and the Discrete
Uniform}\label{general-named-distributions-and-the-discrete-uniform}

So far, our discussion of probability distributions and their summaries
has centered on general results for arbitrary probability mass
functions. The basic premise has been that, by knowing a probability
mass function, you are able to understand the complete behaviour of a
random quantity. Directly from this mass function we are able to derive
summaries for the behaviour, for instance describing the location and
variability of the random variable. In short by knowing the probability
mass function\footnote{\ldots{} and to a lesser extent, the expected
  value and variance.} we immediately understand how the random variable
behaves. We have not, however, spent much time discussing where the
probability mass functions actually \emph{come} from.

We have seen one fairly general probability mass function, the one
deriving from the equally likely outcomes model. This probability mass
function is completely defined by the set of possible values that the
random variable can take on. Suppose that we restrict our attention to
the sample space being a set of \(k\) integers from \(a\) through to
\(a+k\).\footnote{Note that this assumption is not actually restrictive:
  if you have any \(k\) items you can simply label each of the items one
  of the numbers between \(1\) and \(k\) and take \(a=1\).} When setup
in this way, this distribution is often referred to as the
\textbf{discrete uniform distribution}. Typically, we will use the
values for the lower bound (\(a\)) and the upper bound (\(b=a+k\)) to
define \emph{which} discrete uniform we are discussing. If we say that
\(X\) follows a discrete uniform distribution with parameters \(a\) and
\(b\) we are say that \(X\) is a random variable which has an equal
probability of taking any of the integers from \(a\) to \(b\). Put
differently, we have that
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{b-a+1} & x \in\{a,a+1,\dots,b\}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

Whenever we want to say that \(X\) follows a particular distribution,
wwe use a mathematical shorthand to do so. Specifically, we write
\(X \sim \text{Distribution}(\text{parameters})\) to mean ``\(X\)
follows the \(\text{Distribution}\) with \(\text{parameters}\).'' For
instance, if \(X\) represents the results of a fair six-sided die roll,
we can write \(X\sim\text{Discrete Uniform}(1,6)\). We will typically
shorten this to something like \(X\sim\text{D.Unif}(1,6)\). Knowing the
probability mass function of \(X\), we also immediately can work out the
expectation and variance for the random variable. Doing this results in
\(E[X] = \frac{a+b}{2}\) and \(\text{var}(X) = \frac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12}\).
This means that simply by knowing that a random variable follows a
discrete uniform distribution we also immediately know\footnote{Or, if
  we forget, can lookup.} any of the properties that we have discussed
up until this point.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Mean and Variance of Discrete Uniform}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Recall that \(E[X]\) is given by
\[E[X] = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} xp_X(x).\] Thus, if we take \(X\) to be
from the discrete uniform then \begin{align*}
E[X] &= \sum_{x=a}^b x\frac{1}{b-a+1} \\
&= \frac{1}{b-a+1}\sum_{x=a}^b x \\
&= \frac{1}{b-a+1}\times\frac{1}{2}(b-a+1)(a+b) \\
&= \frac{a+b}{2}.
\end{align*} For the variance, we can take the same derivation as above,
this time solving \(E[X^2]\). For this we get \begin{align*}
E[X^2] &= \sum_{x=a}^b x^2\frac{1}{b-a+1} \\
&= \frac{1}{b-a+1}\sum_{x=a}^b x^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{b-a+1}\times\frac{1}{6}(b-a+1)(2a^2 + 2ab - a + 2b^2 + b) \\
&= \frac{2a^2 + 2ab - a + 2b^2 + b}{6}.
\end{align*} Then, \begin{align*}
\text{var}(X) &= E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \\
&= \frac{2a^2 + 2ab - a + 2b^2 + b}{6} - \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2 \\
&= \frac{8a^2 + 8ab - 4a + 8b^2 + 4b - 6a^2 - 12ab - 6b^2}{24} \\
&= \frac{2a^2 - 4ab - 4a + 4b + 2b^2}{24} \\
&= \frac{a^2 - 2ab - 2a + 2b + b^2}{12} \\
&= \frac{a^2 - 2ab - 2a + 2b + b^2 + 1 - 1}{12} \\
&= \frac{(b-a+1)^2 - 1}{12}.
\end{align*}

\end{tcolorbox}

This realization is particularly powerful. There are many real-world
quantities which, through inspection, must follow a discrete uniform
distribution. For instance, consider rolling a die. In the case of a die
roll we take \(a=1\), \(b=6\), and immediately understand that
\(E[X] = 3.5\), that \(\text{var}(X) = \frac{17}{6}\), and that the
probability of each value is \(\frac{1}{6}\). We could do the same
calculations for any die with any sides labeled in consecutive order.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Discrete Uniform
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-discrete-uniform}{}\label{exm-discrete-uniform}

As Charles and Sadie begin to learn about named distributions, they
decide that it is worthwhile to try to find examples of the named
distributions around them. To do so, they start discussing a number of
possibilities, each of them trying to describe whether and how different
quantities obey the distribution.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a discrete uniform would (or would not be)
appropriate, including a description of the parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  At a recent hockey game, Charles and Sadie were spectators and the
  50-50 raffle was selected by choosing the seat number between \(1\)
  and \(4000\).
\item
  Charles' sibling is having a child, and Charles has been thinking
  about what day of the week the child is going to be born on.
\item
  Sadie enjoys playing the birthday-guessing-game when in public,
  wherein Sadie attempts to guess what day of the year random patrons of
  the coffee shop were born on.
\item
  In their free time, Charles and Sadie enjoy playing role-playing
  games. These games often necessitate the rolling of dice, from the
  standard six-sided ones, through to large twenty-sided dice, or
  smaller three-sided ones.
\item
  Charles' struggles to wake up in the mornings and as a result uses an
  alarm that plays a random song on a streaming music service. The song
  is selected from Charles' library at random, keeping each morning
  exciting!
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The winning seat can be treated as a random variable, \(X\), which is
  distributed according to \(\text{D.Unif}(1, 4000)\). The mean and
  variance are not particularly meaningful in this setting, however,
  each individual will have a constant probability of winning.
\item
  If the days of the week are labelled \(1\) through \(7\) (say, Sunday
  through Saturday), then it is reasonable to suspect that \(Y\)
  representing the numerically-encoded day of the week will follow
  approximately a \(\text{D. Unif}(1,7)\). It may be arguable that some
  days are less likely than others to be born on (empirically, Sundays
  appear to have about \(0.12\) which is less than \(1\) in \(7\)),
  however, it is probably a reasonably close approximation.
\item
  Here we can either view Sadie's guess \emph{or} the true birthday as
  the random quantity. If Sadie truly guesses at random then it is
  likely this will follow a \(\text{D. Unif}(1, 365)\), being
  well-represented by the discrete uniform. For one's true birthdays, if
  we are willing to ignore seasonal birth effects and leap years, then
  it is reasonable to assume that it too will be
  \(\text{D. Unif}(1,365)\), however, these are both effects that do
  truly exist and would slightly alter from the uniform probabilities.
\item
  Each roll of the die gives a discrete uniform based on the number of
  sides that it has. For any \(d\) sided die, we can represent it via a
  \(\text{D. Unif}(1,d)\). In these types of games, the mean and
  variance are more pertinent than in most of the other examples we have
  discussed. Importantly, if we roll multiple dice and take a sum (or a
  maximum, minimum, etc.) these no longer will be described by the
  uniform distribution.
\item
  If Charles were to enumerate the songs on the streaming service with
  \(1\) to \(n\), then the played song may follow a
  \(\text{D. Unif}(1, n)\) distribution.\footnotemark{}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Interestingly, shuffle algorithms employed by streaming
companies typically deviate far from the discrete uniform distribution.
When Apple introduced shuffle to the iPod it originally had the next
song be chosen as a discrete uniform over the as-yet unplayed songs.
However, people found that this did not suitably feel \emph{random} as
maybe you would hear the same artist a few times in a row; they moved a
way from an equally-likely model of selection to have people \emph{feel}
like it was more random.}

\end{example}

While the discrete uniform can be useful for real-world applications, it
is also a comparatively simple distribution. The main point of this
discussion is not actually to introduce the discrete uniform, but rather
to introduce the concept of a \textbf{named distribution}. There are
processes in the world which occur frequently enough, in a wide array of
settings, with the same underlying structure for their uncertainty. If
we study one version of these general processes we can derive the mass
function, expectation, and variance for them. Then, we are easily able
to describe the probabilistic behaviour of other quantities following a
similar process. At that point, understanding the uncertainty of random
quantities becomes a matter of matching the processes to the correct
distribution, and then applying what we know about that distribution
directly. While not every process will directly correspond to a known,
named distribution, we can often get very close using just a handful of
these.\footnote{Somewhat interestingly, this phenomenon of getting far
  with a small amount of effort comes up in a large number of contexts.
  Often referred to as the \textbf{80-20 rule} the idea is that \(80\%\)
  of results can be achieved via \(20\%\) of efforts. So, for instance,
  approximately \(80\%\) of processes in the world can be described by
  \(20\%\) of probability distributions. This phenomenon is, itself,
  represented by a named distribution: the \textbf{Pareto distribution}.
  This, for me, is beautifully ironic.}

For each named distribution there is an underlying structure describing
the scenarios in which it arises. For instance, for the discrete
uniform, this is when there is a set of equally likely outcomes which
can be described using consecutive integers. Once matched, there will is
a probability mass function, an expected value, and a variance
associated with the distribution. Importantly, all of these quantities
will depend on some \textbf{parameters}. In the discrete uniform we used
the parameters \(a\) and \(b\). These parameters specify which
\emph{version} of the distribution is relevant for the underlying
scenario.

It is best to think of the named distributions as families of
distributions, with specific iterations being dictated by the parameter
values. If two processes follow the same distribution with different
parameters they will not be identically distributed, they are simply
drawn from the same family. If two processes have the same parameter
values and the same underlying distribution, they are identically
distributed and their probabilistic behaviour will be exactly the same.
For instance, there is no probabilistic difference between rolling a
fair, six-sided die or drawing a card at random from a set of \(6\)
cards labelled \(1\) through \(6\). There may be real-world differences
which matter, but from a probabilistic point of view, they are exactly
the same. This is a useful realization as it allows the use of simple
models to understand more complex phenomenon.

\section{The Bernoulli Distribution}\label{the-bernoulli-distribution}

Perhaps the best way to demonstrate the effectiveness of these simple
models is to introduce one of the most basic named probability
distribution, \textbf{the Bernoulli distribution}.\footnote{The
  Bernoulli distribution is named after Jacob Bernoulli. The Bernoulli
  family was an incredibly prominent family of mathematicians from
  Switzerland, with their hands all over much of mathematics.} The
Bernoulli distribution characterizes any statistical experiment with a
\emph{binary outcome} when these results are denoted \(0\) and \(1\).
The parameter that indexes the distribution is \(p\), which gives the
probability of observing a \(1\). The most straightforward application
of a Bernoulli random variable is the flip of a coin. Take \(X=1\) if a
head is shown, and \(X=0\) if a tails is shown. Then
\(X\sim\text{Bern}(p)\)\footnote{We use \(\text{Bern}\) is used for
  Bernoulli distributions}, with \(p=0.5\). If \(X\sim\text{Bern}(p)\)
then we know that
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} p^x(1-p)^{1-x} & x\in\{0,1\}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
Further, we can show that that \(E[X] = p\) and
\(\text{var}(X) = p(1-p)\). We typically call \(X=1\) a ``success'' and
\(X=0\) a ``failure'' when discussing Bernoulli random variables.

A coin flip is, by itself, not particularly interesting. However
\emph{any} statistical experiment with binary outcomes coded this way
can be seen as a Bernoulli random variable. Suppose, for instance, you
are interested in whether you will pass a particular course or not.
There are two options, a ``success'' (passing) and a ``failure''
(failing), and the chances of this are governed by some probability
\(p\). Alternatively, suppose you want to know whether the next flight
you take will land safely, or whether a particular medical treatment
will effectively treat an illness. These are the same situations. Each
of these scenarios is analyzed in exactly the same way as a coin toss:
the probabilities change, but the underlying functions and mathematical
objects do not. There is no probabilistic difference between determining
whether a coin will come up heads or whether a plane will safely land.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Bernoulli
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-bernoulli}{}\label{exm-bernoulli}

In their ongoing quest to best understand the named distributions,
Charles ans Sadie continue their discussions of various quantities, and
how they may fit a Bernoulli distribution.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a Bernoulli distribution would (or would not be)
appropriate, including a description of the parameter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles and Sadie think about entering their favourite coffee shop,
  and seeing whether or not there is seating available for them.
\item
  Charles thinks about the games that they have played deciding on who
  would have to pay, based on the outcomes of a few coin tosses.
\item
  Sadie is going on a trip shortly, and wonders whether or not the plane
  will be running on schedule.
\item
  Charles and Sadie are big sports fans, and want to know whether the
  local team will win the upcoming match.
\item
  Sadie wants to take out a book from the library, but is not sure
  whether it is available.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In this case we can treat \(X=1\) as there being seating available
  (``success'') and \(X=0\) as there not being seating available. The
  parameter, \(p\) would be given by the probability that there is
  seating available, which is likely not a known probability directly.
\item
  In this case we can treat \(X=1\) as Sadie having to pay, with \(X=0\)
  as Charles having to pay. The parameter \(p\) corresponds to the
  probability that Sadie pays, which in most of the original examples
  would have \(p=0.5\).
\item
  In this case we can treat \(X=1\) as the plane being on time, and
  \(X=0\) as it being late. The parameter \(p\) would correspond to the
  probability that the plane is late.
\item
  In this case we can treat \(X=1\) as the team winning the game, and
  \(X=0\) as them losing. The parameter \(p\) would correspond to the
  probability that they win.
\item
  In this case we can treat \(X=1\) as the book being available, and
  \(X=0\) as it being not available. The parameter \(p\) would
  correspond to the probability that it is available.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{The Binomial Distribution}\label{the-binomial-distribution}

A natural extension to tossing a coin once and seeing if it comes up
heads or not is tossing a coin \(n\) times and counting how many times
it comes up heads. If we take \(X\) to be the number of ``successes'' in
\(n\) independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials, then we
say that \(X\) has a \textbf{binomial distribution}. The binomial
distribution is characterized by two different parameters, the number of
trials that are being performed, denoted \(n\), and the probability of a
success on each trial, \(p\). We write \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)\).

\begin{example}[Missing All the Good
Games]\protect\hypertarget{exm-binomial}{}\label{exm-binomial}

Charles and Sadie often will attend hockey games together for their
local team. In order to keep their costs down, they try not to go to
every single game. Instead, each time a game comes around that they can
both attend, they roll a die. If it is a \(3\) or higher, they go,
otherwise they stay home. One season they are looking back over the
\(30\) games, and seeing which they attended and which they did not. The
team won \(19\) of the games, and lost the other \(11\). However, of the
\(18\) games that Charles and Sadie attended that season, they saw all
\(11\) losses and only \(7\) of the wins! They cannot help but feel like
they got very unlucky.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How many wins should Charles and Sadie have expected to see?
\item
  What is the variance in the number of wins that they could have
  expected?
\item
  What is the probability that, for a season record of \(19\) wins and
  \(11\) losses, they would have been present for \(7\) or fewer wins?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Suppose that we take \(X\) to represent the number of winning games that
Sadie and Charles are present for. In this case, looking back on the
season, we know that \(X\) is going to be binomial with \(n=19\) and
\(p = \dfrac{2}{3}\), since they go if a \(3\) or greater is rolled on
the die. Thus, we can take \(X \sim \text{Bin}(19, \dfrac{2}{3})\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(E[X] = np = \dfrac{2}{3}(19) = 12.666\). Thus they should have
  expected to see around \(12\) or \(13\) wins.
\item
  \(\text{var}(X) = np(1-p) = 4.222\).
\item
  We want \(P(X \leq 7)\). For this we get \begin{align*}
  P(X \leq 7) &= \sum_{x=0}^7 p_X(x) \\
  &= \sum_{x=0}^7 \binom{19}{x}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^x\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{19-x} \\
  &= \frac{2876233}{387420489} \\
  &\approx 0.0074.
  \end{align*} This leaves them very unlucky.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

If we know that \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)\) then we also know that
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} \binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} & x\in\{0,1,\dots,n\} \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
This is the first distribution we have seen which knowing the underlying
distribution would not have immediately translated into knowing the
probability mass function, which begins to illustrate why this is a
useful area of study. We can work out that \(E[X] = np\) and
\(\text{var}(X) = np(1-p)\).

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Binomial
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-binomial-list}{}\label{exm-binomial-list}

The adventures in understanding named distributions continue, this time
Charles ans Sadie wonder where they may find Binomial distributions.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a Binomial distribution would (or would not be)
appropriate, including a description of the parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles rolls ten, six-sided dice, counting up the number of them
  which show a \(1\).
\item
  Charles and Sadie reflect on the record of who has paid during their
  past \(20\) visits to the coffee shop.
\item
  Sadie starts playing on a baseball league that uses a pitching
  machine, and wants to know, without practicing, how many hits occur in
  the first \(20\) \emph{at bats}.
\item
  Charles and Sadie distribute flyers for an upcoming concert that their
  folk-punk band is putting on. They hand out \(50\) flyers and are
  wondering how many people will show.
\item
  Charles and Sadie form a pub trivia team with some friends. One day,
  their friend who specializes in history is gone one day, and \(5\)
  multiple choice history questions come up. They want to know what
  their score will be randomly guessing on those questions.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of dice showing a \(1\) is represented by a
  \(\text{Bin}(10, \dfrac{1}{6})\) distribution. Each die has an equal
  chance of showing a \(1\), independently from all other rolls, and
  each roll will definitely be either a \(1\) or not a \(1\).
\item
  We can take \(X\) to represent the number of times that Charles has
  paid. This will be given by a \(\text{Bin}(20, 0.5)\) distribution.
  Each time both are equally likely to pay, independent of all other
  times, and one of them will always pay.
\item
  We can take \(X\) to be the number of hits, and then claim that this
  will follow a \(\text{Bin}(20, p)\) distribution, where \(p\) is the
  probability that Sadie makes a hit. The caveats that the pitching
  machine is used and that Sadie does not practice are important since
  if different pitches were used, or different skill levels emerged as
  time progresses, then it may not satisfy the conditions of a binomial
  distribution.
\item
  Here we can take \(X\), the number who attend the show, as a
  \(\text{Bin}(50,p)\), where \(p\) is the probability that any
  individual who saw the flyer attends the show. In order for this to
  hold we need to assume that all individuals choose to attend or not
  individually, without influence from anyone else, and that the
  probability is constant across different people.
\item
  Suppose that there are \(4\) multiple choice options, then the number
  they answer correctly will follow a \(\text{Bin}(5,0.25)\)
  distribution. Assuming that their guesses are independent across the
  different questions, and that they do not have a better sense for some
  questions than others.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Note that the binomial distribution can be constructed by summing
independent and identically distributed Bernoulli variables.
Specifically, if
\(X_1,\dots,X_n\stackrel{iid}{\sim}\text{Bern}(p)\)\footnote{Note,
  \(\stackrel{iid}{\sim}\) means ``independent and identically
  distributed according to\ldots{}''} then taking
\[Y = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\] gives a binomial distribution, with \(n\) and
\(p\). To understand this intuitively, note that if a Bernoulli comes up
\(1\) when we get a heads on a single flip of the coin, then if we flip
the coin \(n\) times and count the number of heads this is the same as
counting the number of \(1\)s from each corresponding Bernoulli trial.
Once we know this construction, we can use the properties we have
previously seen about independent random variables to work out the mean
and variance for the distribution.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Construction of Binomial Random Variables}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Suppose that we take
\(X_1,\dots,X_n \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \text{Bern}(p)\). Then, if we
define \[Y = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\] we can work out \(E[Y]\) and
\(\text{var}(Y)\) directly. First,
\[E[Y] = E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i] = nE[X_i] = np.\]
Moreover, owing to independence we get
\[\text{var}(Y) = \text{var}(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{var}(X_i) = np(1-p).\]
These are the same as what was listed for the binomial directly. We are
also able to derive the probability mass function of the binomial using
this construction.

If we note that \(P(X_1 = x) = p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x}\), then be independence
we cna write the joint probability mass function as the product of
these, which gives:
\begin{multline*}P(X_1=x_1, X_2 = x_2, \dots, X_k = x_k) = p^{x_1}(1-p)^{1-x_1}p^{x_2}(1-p)^{1-x_2}\cdots p^{x_n}(1-p)^{1-x_n} \\ = p^{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}(1-p)^{n-\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} = p^{y}(1-p)^{n-y}.\end{multline*}
Consider how we could have \(Y = k\), for some \(k\in\{0,\dots,n\}\). In
order for this to be the case we would require exactly \(k\) of the
\(n\) Bernoulli random variables to be \(1\) and the other \(n-k\) to be
\(0\). So, for instance, we may have
\(\{X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, \dots, X_k = 1, X_{k+1} = 0, \dots, X_n = 0\}\).
If we consider choosing which of the \(n\) trials should be \(1\), we
know that there will be \(\binom{n}{k}\) of these, and so that gives the
number of disjoint combinations that satisfy \(Y=k\). Combining this
with the joint probability mass function we worked out gives
\[P(Y=y) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k},\] as required.

\end{tcolorbox}

It is important to note that, to get the binomial distribution, we have
made several key assumptions. First, we are counting the number of
successes in a \textbf{fixed} number of trials. In order for something
to be binomially distributed, we must know in advance how many trials
there are under consideration. Second, each of these trials must be
independent of one another. The outcome on one cannot impact any of the
others. Third, there must be a constant probability of success across
all trials. If the probabilities are shifting overtime, then a binomial
is no longer appropriate.

\begin{example}[Charles' and Sadie's Binomial
Mistakes]\protect\hypertarget{exm-binomial-assumption-violations}{}\label{exm-binomial-assumption-violations}

In trying to learn about the binomial distribution, Charles and Sadie
identified several candidates for quantities which did not satisfy a
binomial distribution. For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie
understand why a Binomial distribution would not be appropriate.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles rolls ten dice, of various different sizes, counting up the
  number of them which show a \(1\).
\item
  Charles and Sadie are considering the weather for the next week,
  thinking about how many days there will be rain.
\item
  Charles and Sadie consider handing out flyers for their band's
  concert, and give \(10\) flyers to a group of \(10\) friends walking
  by.
\item
  Sadie is considering a particular major league baseball player,
  considering the number of hits in a set number of \emph{at bats}.
\item
  Charles and Sadie are playing a game where they roll a die, then flip
  a coin the number of times that is shown on the die, counting up the
  total number of heads.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The issue in this case is that, if the dice have different numbers of
  sides, the probability that they show a \(1\) will not be constant. As
  a result, there is no value of \(p\) that gives the probability of
  success on each trial.
\item
  The issue in this case is two-fold. First, it is unlikely that there
  is going to be a constant probability of rain. Even if there is, or we
  treat it as though it will be, it is unlikely that one day is
  independent of the next, all the time. That is to say, today's weather
  likely impacts tomorrows, removing independence.
\item
  In this case, it is unlikely that the group of \(10\) friends will
  independently decide to go or not. Likely if one goes, many will, and
  vice versa.
\item
  The issue here is that batters will bat against different pitches,
  which changes the probability of a hit. That is, some pitchers are
  less talented, and thus there is a higher probability of getting a hit
  against them.
\item
  The issue here is that there is not a set number of trials. Instead,
  the number of trials is random and dependent on the outcome of a
  previous statistical experiment.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{The Geometric Distribution}\label{the-geometric-distribution}

The binomial counted the number of successes in a fixed number of
trials. We may be interested in a related question, namely ``how many
trials would be needed to see a success?'' Instead of ``how many heads
in \(n\) flips of a coin?'' we may ask ``how many flips of a coin to get
a head?'' Much like the binomial, these quantities will be intimately
tied to the Bernoulli distribution. Once more we are envisioning a
sequence of independent and identically distributed trials being
performed. However, instead of knowing that we will stop after \(n\)
trials have been conducted, here we will only stop once we see a
particular result. Any random quantities following this process are said
to follow a \textbf{geometric distribution}. The geometric distribution
is parameterized with a single parameter, \(p\), the probability of
success. We write \(X\sim\text{Geo}(p)\), and have that
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}(1-p)^{x-1}p & x \geq 1 \\  0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
If \(X\sim\text{Geo}(p)\), then \(E[X] = \frac{1}{p}\) and
\(\text{var}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}\).

\begin{example}[Charles Plays
Darts]\protect\hypertarget{exm-geometric}{}\label{exm-geometric}

Sadie is a very accomplished darts player. Charles is not. Despite
Sadie's best efforts, when Charles plays darts it is essentially
randomly choosing an area on the dartboard. In one friendly game,
Charles decides to only aim at the highest scoring region of the board -
the triple twenty. This region occupies about \(0.9\%\) of the total
area, and the two friends play with a rule where if Charles misses
entirely, another dart is thrown. Charles is curious as to how many
darts are going to be needed to be thrown until a triple twenty is hit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Find the expected number of darts required.
\item
  Find the variance in the total number of darts required.
\item
  What is the probability that it takes \textbf{more} than \(5\) total
  throws to get a triple twenty?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

This is a geometric distribution with \(p=0.009\). Let
\(X \sim \text{Geo}(p)\) represent the number of darts that Charles
sees.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The expected number of darts required, \(E[X]\) is given by \(1/p\),
  which is \(\dfrac{1}{0.009} = 111.\dot1\).
\item
  The variance of the expected number of darts, \(\text{var}(X)\) is
  given by \(\frac{1-p}{p^2} = 12234.5679\).
\item
  To find \(P(X \geq 5)\) it is simpler to work with
  \(P(X < 5) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X = 3) + P(X=4)\). Then we take
  \begin{align*}
   P(X \geq 5) &= 1 - P(X < 5) \\
   &= 1 - (P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X = 3) + P(X=4))\\
   &= 1 - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{1-1} - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{2-1} \\
   &\quad - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{3-1} - (0.009)(1-0.009)^{4-1} \\
   &= 1 - (0.009)[1 + 0.991 + 0.991^2 + 0.991^3] \\
   &= 0.964483...
  \end{align*} Thus, with more than \(96\%\) probability, Charles will
  take \(X\) or more dart throws to hit the triple twenty.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

The geometric distribution differs from other named distributions that
we have considered in that the random variable can take on an infinite
number of possible values. The probability that \(X\) exceeds a very
large threshold shrinks to \(0\), however, there is no maximum value
that can be observed. To form the geometric random variable we assume
that we are performing independent and identically distributed Bernoulli
trials, and that we stop only after the first observed
success.\footnote{In the framing we are using here, the random variable
  \(X\) counts the total number of trials \emph{including} the trail
  upon which the first success was reached. Sometimes you may see this
  distribution parameterized slightly differently, taking \(X\) to
  instead count the number of failures before the first success. To
  convert between the two framings we need only subtract \(1\). There is
  no meaningful difference in the underlying behaviour.}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Geometric
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-geometric-examples}{}\label{exm-geometric-examples}

Still working through their distributional knowledge, Charles and Sadie
are now hoping to identify geometric quantities.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a Geometric distribution would (or would not be)
appropriate, including a description of the parameter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles continues to roll a six-sided die until a \(6\) is gotten.
\item
  Sadie has paid for coffee for the last several times, they are both
  wondering how many more times until Charles will have to pay.
\item
  Charles is considering a new job which would require a whole lot of
  plane travel, and so Charles begins to wonder how many flights will
  run on time before the first delay.
\item
  Sadie, in a round of guess-their-birthday, starts to count the number
  of people it takes (guessing one birthday for each person) until a
  birthday is guessed correctly.
\item
  Charles and Sadie very much enjoy a particular brand of vegan peach
  yogurt, but it is hard to find. They want to consider how many stores
  they need to visit before they find it in stock.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  This will be \(\text{Geo}(\dfrac{1}{6})\), as the trials are all
  independent and identically distributed, and the rolling stops at the
  first success.
\item
  If we define ``Charles has to pay'' as a success, then the number of
  visits to the coffee shop, starting today, until Charles pays will be
  \(\text{Geo}(\dfrac{1}{2})\). Each trial is independent and
  identically distributed, and we stop counting when Charles pays.
\item
  In order for this to follow a geometric distribution we would require
  that each plane is equally likely to be delayed, and that there is no
  influence from one plane to another. If so, we take \(p\) to be the
  probability that a plane is delayed, and then \(X\) is the number of
  flights up-to and including the first delayed flight, and
  \(X\sim\text{Geo}(p)\).
\item
  Assuming that Sadie makes guesses independently of one another, each
  with a probability of \(\dfrac{1}{365}\) of being correct, then this
  will be \(X\sim\text{Geo}(\dfrac{1}{365})\).
\item
  If each store stocks with probability, \(p\), then the total number of
  stores until they purchase will be \(\text{Geo}(p)\). However, this
  will assume that each store is out-of-stock independently of each
  other store, and this seems unlikely to be the case supposing (for
  instance) a common supplier.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{The Negative Binomial
Distribution}\label{the-negative-binomial-distribution}

A natural way to make the geometric distribution more flexible is to not
stop after the first success, but rather after a set number of
successes. That is, instead of flipping a coin until we see a head, we
flip a coin until we see \(r\) heads. Any random quantity which follows
this general pattern is said to follow a \textbf{negative binomial
distribution}. We use two parameters to describe the negative binomial
distribution, \(r\) the number of successes we are looking to achieve,
and \(p\) the probability of a success on any given trial. We write
\(X\sim\text{NB}(r,p)\). If we know that \(X\sim\text{NB}(r,p)\), then
we immediately get
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r} & x\geq r \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
Moreover, we have \(E[X] = \frac{r}{p}\) and
\(\text{var}(X) = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}\). Setting \(r=1\), we get the same
quantities explored in the case of the geometric distribution. That is,
if \(X \sim \text{NB}(1,p)\) then we can also say that
\(X \sim \text{Geo}(p)\).\footnote{Like with the geometric distribution,
  we have taken \(X\) to represent the total number of trials
  considered, including the \(r\) successes. There are alternative
  parameterizations which would count how many \emph{failures} occur
  prior to the \(r\)th success, which can be viewed as the value we
  consider minus \(r\).}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Try to Balance the Dart
Game]\protect\hypertarget{exm-negative-binomial}{}\label{exm-negative-binomial}

Charles and Sadie have been continuing to play darts quite often
together, and though Charles is improving, Sadie's expertise still makes
it an unfair game. As a result, they consider playing alternative
versions of the game in which Sadie is at a disadvantage in order to
make things more \emph{fair}. Charles has improved so that \(20\%\) of
the time, the aimed for area of the dart board is hit. Sadie, on the
other hand, hits with \(60\%\) accuracy. Suppose that they are
considering a game where Charles has to hit a spot \(3\) times, and then
Sadie has to hit the same spot \(r\) times. They are trying to figure
out \(r\) to make the game fair.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How many tosses will it take, on average, for Charles to hit the area
  on the target \(3\) times?
\item
  What should Charles and Sadie make \(r\), if they want it to take
  Sadie the same number of tosses on average as Charles?
\item
  If they set \(r\) as in (b), who has a higher variance in the number
  of tosses it takes?
\item
  What is the probability that Charles wins before Sadie has a chance to
  win?
\item
  What is the probability that Sadie wins on the first available turn?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Let \(X\) be the number of tosses it takes for Charles and \(Y\) to be
the number of tosses it takes for Sadie. We have that
\(X \sim \text{NB}(3, 0.2)\), while \(Y\sim\text{NB}(r, 0.6)\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We know that \(E[X] = \dfrac{3}{0.2} = 15\).
\item
  We have that \(E[Y] = \dfrac{r}{0.6}\). Setting this equal to \(15\)
  gives \[\frac{r}{0.6} = 15 \implies r = 15(0.6) = 9.\] Thus, they
  should set \(r = 9\).
\item
  We have that \(\text{var}(X) = \dfrac{3(0.8)}{0.2^2} = 60\) while
  \(\text{var}(Y) = \dfrac{9(0.4)}{0.6^2} = 10\). Thus, Charles has a
  far greater variance in the total number of tosses than Sadie.
\item
  In order for Charles to win before Sadie has a chance, this would
  require \(X < 9\). Thus, \begin{align*}
  P(X < 9) &= \sum_{x=3}^8 p_X(x) \\
  &= \sum_{x=3}^8 \binom{x-1}{2}(0.2)^3(0.8)^{x-3} \\
  &= \left(\frac{0.2}{0.8}\right)^3\left[\binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{2}(0.8) + \binom{4}{2}(0.8)^2 + \binom{5}{2}(0.8)^3 \right.\\
  &\quad\left.+ \binom{6}{2}(0.8)^4 + \binom{7}{2}(0.8)^5\right] \\
  &= \frac{79329}{390625} \approx 0.203.
  \end{align*} Thus, approximately \(20\%\) of the time Charles will win
  before Sadie even can.
\item
  The probability that Sadie wins on the first turn is \(P(Y = 9)\). We
  get
  \[p_Y(9) = \binom{8}{8}(0.6)^9(0.4)^{9-9} = \frac{19683}{1953125} = 0.010078.\]
  Thus it is only around a \(1\%\) chance that Sadie wins on turn \(9\),
  the earliest possible turn for it.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Negative Binomial
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-negative-binomial-list}{}\label{exm-negative-binomial-list}

Having mastered many different distributions, Charles and Sadie fix
their attention of finding the negative binomial quantities in the world
around them.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a negative binomial distribution would (or would
not be) appropriate, including a description of the parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}

\item

  account. If Charles and Sadie's order comes to \(\$6.25\) per trip,
  how many trips until the account needs to be restocked.
\item
  Sadie decided that poker is very fun to play after the first time
  getting a royal flush.\footnote{Note, a royal flush is the set of
    cards \(10\) through ace of a single suit. This is the most rare
    poker hand in a standard game, occurring in only \(4\) ways of the

  how many more hands of poker are likely to be needed until this
  feeling comes around a few more times.
\item
  Charles is continuing to crochet. Charles wants to know how many

  without any errors to give as holiday gifts this year.

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Each trial here is independent, identically distributed with a
  constant probability. Charles stops after \(6\) successes, and as a
  result the negative binomial is satisfied. \(X\) will follows a
  \(\text{NB}(6, \dfrac{1}{6})\) distribution.
\item
  Note that at \(\$6.25\) per order, \(\$100\) buys \(16\) orders. As a
  result, this process will end after \(16\) ``successes'', which is to
  say, times when Charles has to pay. We know from past examples that
  the probability Charles pays is \(0.5\), independent of all other
  cases, and as a result this will follow a \(\text{NB}(16, 0.5)\)
  distribution.
\item
  The probability of getting a royal flush is constant in poker
  hands\footnotemark{} Moreover, Sadie is interested in a set number of
  royal flushes being achieved (a few more maybe means \(3\) or so), and
  as a result, this falls into the category of negative binomial with
  \(r\) set to the number Sadie wants to see, and \(p\) being the
  probability of seeing a royal flush, which is approximately
  \(\dfrac{4}{\binom{52}{5}}\), depending on the type of poker being
  played.
\item
  Assuming that there are a set number of holiday gifts that Charles
  wants to give, then we can take this to be \(r\) from the negative
  binomial distribution. Assuming that Charles' odds of making a mistake
  on any granny square are constant at \(p\), then we can take the
  probability of success as \(1-p\). Under these assumptions, and
  assuming the squares are all independent of one another, then this
  will be \(\text{NB}(r, 1-p)\).
\item
  If we assume that each house, independently, buys chocolate bars with
  a constant probability, \(p\), then this will follow a
  \(\text{NB}(10, p)\) distribution.

\section{The Hypergeometric
Distribution}\label{the-hypergeometric-distribution}

One of the use cases demonstrated for the binomial distribution is
drawing \emph{with} replacement. In order for the binomial distribution
to be relevant it must be the case that the probability of a success is
unchanging, and correspondingly, if the process under consideration is
random draws from a population then these draws must be with
replacement. Otherwise the probabilities would shift.\footnote{Note, if
  the population size is large enough drawing with or without
  replacement is essentially the same thing. Sometimes, in sufficiently
  large populations, we do not differentiate between draws with and
  without replacement.} Suppose that we are wish to draw the ace of
spades from a standard, shuffled deck of \(52\) cards. If we begin
drawing cards without returning them to the deck after each draw, the
probability that the next draw is the ace of spades is increasing over
the draws. At first, the probability is \(\dfrac{1}{52}\). If the first
card is not the ace of spades, then the next draw it will be
\(\dfrac{1}{51}\). This continues until eventually the probability will
grow to be \(1\). As a result, this type of scenario does not fit into
the independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials that we
have been exploring.

We require a different setup to model drawing \textbf{without}
replacement from a finite population. Suppose that our population
consists of two types of items, ``successes'' and ``failures''. If we
are interested in counting how many successes we see in a set number of
draws, then this random quantity will follow a \textbf{hypergeometric
distribution}. The hypergeometric distribution is parameterized using
three different parameters: the number of items in the population,
\(N\), the number of these which are considered successes, \(M\), and
the total number of items that are to be drawn without replacement,
\(n\). We write \(X\sim\text{HG}(N,M,n)\). If \(X\sim\text{HG}(N,M,n)\)
then
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases}\frac{\binom{N-M}{n-x}\binom{M}{x}}{\binom{N}{n}} & x\in\{\max\{0,M-N+n\},\dots,\min\{n,M\}\} \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
Moreover, \(E[X] = \frac{nM}{N}\) and the variance is given by
\[\text{var}(X) = n\frac{M}{N}\frac{N-M}{N}\frac{N-n}{N-1}.\]

\begin{example}[Charles Sock
Drawer]\protect\hypertarget{exm-hyper-geometric}{}\label{exm-hyper-geometric}

Charles firmly believes that socks should not be sold in
pairs.\footnote{What happens if you lose on sock? Why must you replace
  both of them? You can wear either sock on either foot. It really seems
  to be unnecessary that you cannot buy one at a time.} As a result,
Charles has decided to keep socks unpaired, free floating in the
drawers. In Charles' sock drawer there are \(13\) individual white
socks, \(8\) individual black socks, and \(9\) individual red socks. One
day, Charles is trying to wear matching socks because of a fancy dinner
party, however, it is dark when the socks are being selected.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If Charles takes two socks from the drawer, what is the probability
  that there is a matching pair of white socks?
\item
  If Charles takes two socks from the drawer, what is the probability
  that there is a matching pair of \textbf{any} colour?
\item
  If Charles takes \(5\) socks, how many of them are expected to be red?
  What is the variance of the number of red socks?
\item
  How many socks should Charles take out in order to expect to receive
  at least \(2\) black socks?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

We can view this as a hypergeometric distribution, where the specific
parameters depend on what we are defining as a success. There will
always be \(N=30\), and \(n\) will correspond to the number of socks
that are drawn.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Here there are \(M=13\) successes, \(N=30\), and \(n=2\). We wish to
  know \(p_X(2)\), and so we find
  \[p_X(2) = \frac{\binom{N-M}{n-x}\binom{M}{x}}{\binom{N}{n}} = \frac{\binom{30-13}{0}\binom{13}{2}}{\binom{30}{2}} = \frac{26}{145} \approx 0.1793.\]
\item
  We can say that
  \(P(\text{Pair}) = P(\text{Pair of White}) + P(\text{Pair of Red}) + P(\text{Pair of Black})\).
  We found \(P(\text{Pair of White})\) in (a), and the remaining terms
  will be similar, changing \(M=9\) for the red socks, and \(M=8\) for
  the black socks. Thus, \begin{align*}
   P(\text{Pair of Red}) &= \frac{\binom{30-9}{0}\binom{9}{2}}{\binom{30}{2}} \\
   &= \frac{12}{145} \\
   P(\text{Pair of Black}) &= \frac{\binom{30-8}{0}\binom{8}{2}}{\binom{30}{2}} \\
   &= \frac{28}{435} \\
   P(\text{Pair}) &= \frac{26}{145} + \frac{12}{145} + \frac{28}{435} \\
   &= \frac{142}{435} \\
   &= 0.3264.
  \end{align*} Thus, there is approximately a \(33\%\) chance that
  Charles draws a pair of socks.
\item
  Here we have \(M=9\) and \(n=5\). Thus, we find
  \[E[X] = \frac{(5)(9)}{30} = 1.5,\] and so \(1.5\) red socks are to be
  expected.\footnotemark{} For the variance, we get
  \[\text{var}(X) = 5\cdot\frac{9}{30}\cdot\frac{30-9}{30}\cdot\frac{30-5}{30-1} = \frac{105}{116} \approx 0.905.\]
\item
  In this case we want \(M=8\). In order to have \(E[X] \geq 2\) we
  require
  \[\frac{n(8)}{30} \geq 2 \implies n \geq \frac{2(30)}{8} = 7.5,\] and
  so Charles should draw at least \(8\) socks in order to expect to have
  at least \(2\) black socks in the set of drawn ones.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Now, \(1.5\) socks can never be observed. As a result, you
may say that Charles expects to see either \(1\) or \(2\) red socks,
though, recall our way of interpreting the expected value.}

\end{example}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Hypergeometric Distribution, Binomial Distribution, and Survey
Sampling}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

The hypergeometric is closely linked to the binomial distribution. If we
consider the population described in the hypergeometric setup then the
probability of a success on the first draw is \(p=\frac{M}{N}\). Note
that \(E[X] = np\), exactly the same as in the binomial. However,
plugging this in for the variance we get
\(\text{var}(X) = np(1-p)\frac{N-n}{N-1}\). Notice that if \(n=1\), this
extra term is simply \(1\), and for \(n > 1\) it will be less than
\(1\). As a result, the variance of the hypergeometric is smaller than
the variance of the corresponding binomial. This makes intuitive sense.
In the hypergeometric setup, the fact that draws are without replacement
means that as more draws go on the probability of observing a success
increases, reducing the likelihood of long runs of no observed
successes. There is a cap on the behaviour of the random quantity thanks
to the finiteness of the population. Correspondingly, the multiplicative
term by which the variance shrinks, \(\frac{N-n}{N-1}\) is referred to
as the \textbf{finite population correction}. This factor differentiates
the behaviour of the hypergeometric and the binomial.

Note that as \(N\) becomes very, very large, as long as \(n\) is small
by comparison, the finite population correction will approach \(1\). In
other words, drawing without replacement in a large enough sample
behaves almost exactly the same as drawing with replacement in the same
sample. The binomial distribution can be used to approximate the
hypergeometric distribution, so long as the population is very large.
Again, this makes sense intuitively. If you have a deck with a million
cards in it, and you are going to draw \(2\), whether or not you return
the first one to the deck has very little bearing on the probabilities
associated with this scenario. Generally, the binomial distribution is
easier to work with, so this approximation can be useful in some
settings.

These types of considerations are deeply important in the field of
\textbf{survey sampling}. In survey sampling, researchers select
individuals from a population of interest, and have them respond to
questions, or collect information on the respondents. You can think of,
for instance, surveys that the university sends out or Canada-wide
surveys trying to gauge sentiment on various policies. Generally in a
survey you are going to be sampling \emph{without} replacement: you will
not include the same person in your sample more than once. However, it
may also be the case that you are taking a fairly small sample (say
\(n=1000\)) from a very large population (say \(N=40000000\)), at which
point the finite population correction factor equals \(0.999975\). This
may as well be \(1\) and you can simplify matters by using binomial
probabilities.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Hypergeometric
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-hyper-geometric-list}{}\label{exm-hyper-geometric-list}

Charles and Sadie have almost made it through the set of distributions
that they want to learn, now moving on to the hypergeometric.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a hypergeometric distribution would (or would not
be) appropriate, including a description of the parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  When streaming music, Charles will often shuffle the entire library.
  While listening through, Charles keeps tracks of the number of songs
  that come on which are favourites.
\item
  Sadie is considering the number of spades that are likely to show up
  in different poker hands, from different versions of the game where
  hands may not be \(5\) cards.
\item
  Charles and Sadie run a book club with some of their closest friends.
  Before each meeting, they take an anonymous vote as to whether the
  book was enjoyed or not, so that they know the total number of
  individuals who actually enjoyed the reading. If they know how many
  people will show up to a meeting, they are interested in how many of
  those people will have enjoyed the book.
\item
  Sadie learns of black swans, and wants to understand how many are
  likely to be seen if Sadie starts to view swans at a swan sanctuary.
\item
  Charles and Sadie are invited to partake in a survey. The survey is
  concerned with the number of people living in their town who support
  investments into transit infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  This will be hypergeometric assuming that the shuffle algorithm does
  not play the same songs multiple times in a session. Here \(N\) is the
  total number of songs in the library, \(M\) is the number of songs
  which Charles considers to be favourites, and \(n\) is the number that
  Charles decides to listen to.
\item
  Assuming that the carts are dealt without replacement this will be
  hypergeometric. There are \(N=52\) total cards, \(M=13\) spades, and
  then \(n\) will correspond to the size of the hand (such as \(5\) or
  \(3\) or \(8\)).
\item
  This will be hypergeometric, assuming that there is actually random
  attendance at the meetings. Here, \(M\) will correspond to the number
  of individuals who enjoyed the book, \(N\) is the total size of the
  book club, and \(n\) is the number of people who can attend any given
  meeting.
\item
  In order for this to be hypergeometric, we would need to assume that
  Sadie is able to tell apart the different swans, so as to not count
  them more than once. In this case, \(M\) is the total number of black
  swans at the sanctuary, \(N\) is the total number of swans at the
  sanctuary, and \(n\) is the number of swans that Sadie looks at.
\item
  This will typically be a hypergeometric, as most surveys are without
  replacement. Here, \(N\) is the size of the possible population of
  individuals being surveyed, \(n\) is the size of the survey, and \(M\)
  is the number of people in the town who support investments into
  transit infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{The Poisson Distribution}\label{the-poisson-distribution}

The hypergeometric strayed from the pattern of the previously introduced
distributions by not being represented as a sequence of Bernoulli
trials. However, it was still characterized by a sequence of repeated
trials. While many statistical experiments can be framed in this way,
there are of course processes which are not described by repeated
trials. Consider, for instance, any process where something is observed
for a set period of times and events may or may not occur during this
interval. Perhaps you sit on the side of the road and count the number
of cars traveling by a particular intersection over the course of an
hour. Each car going by is an event, but in this setting, the number of
events is the random quantity itself. None of the distributions
discussed until this point are suited to this type of process.

When we have events which occur at a constant rate, and our interest is
in the number of events which occur, then we can make use of the
\textbf{Poisson distribution}.\footnote{The Poisson distribution gets it
  name from the French mathematician, Siméon Poisson, rather than from
  the french word for \emph{fish}. Though, I suppose it is likely that
  the surname came from the french word for fish, so in a roundabout
  way, the distribution is sort of the \emph{Fish Distribution}.} The
Poisson distribution takes a single parameter, \(\lambda\), which is the
average rate of occurrence of the events over the time period we are
interested in. We write \(X\sim\text{Poi}(\lambda)\). If
\(X\sim\text{Poi}(\lambda)\) then
\[p_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
Moreover, \(E[X]=\lambda\) and \(\text{var}(X) = \lambda\).\footnote{The
  Poisson distribution is interesting in that the mean and variance are
  always equal to one another.}

\begin{example}[Charles' Novella
Mistakes]\protect\hypertarget{exm-poi-dist}{}\label{exm-poi-dist}

Charles has decided to write a short novella. Hard at work, the novella
turns out to be \(105\) pages, at the time of completion. Charles sends
a copy off to the printer excited to share it with Sadie. After
printing, Charles realizes that the spellcheck on the program indicates
that there is a total of \(215\) errors. Mortified that these were not
corrected before handing it over to Sadie, Charles starts to work out
just how bad the situation is likely to be.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the average number of mistakes per page of the novella?
\item
  What is the variance for the number of mistakes per page in the
  novella?
\item
  What is the probability that there were no mistakes on the first page?
\item
  What is the probability that there were five or more mistakes on the
  first page?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  On average there will be \(\dfrac{215}{105} = \dfrac{43}{21}\) errors
  per page. We can take the distribution to be
  \(\text{Poi}(\dfrac{43}{21})\).
\item
  The variance for a Poisson distribution is given by \(\lambda\). Thus,
  it will be \(\dfrac{215}{105} = \dfrac{43}{21}\).
\item
  Here we want \(p_X(0)\). This is given by
  \[p_X(0) = \frac{e^{-43/21}(43/21)^0}{0!} = e^{-43/21} \approx 0.129.\]
  Thus, there is about a \(13\%\) chance that there are no errors on the
  first page.
\item
  Here we want
  \(P(X \geq 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - (p_X(0) + p_X(1) + p_X(2) + p_X(3) + p_X(4))\).
  Solving this directly gives \begin{align*}
   P(X \geq 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) &= 1 - \sum_{x=0}^4 p_X(x) \\
   &= 1 - \sum_{x=0}^4 \frac{e^{-43/21}(43/21)^x}{x!} \\
   &\approx 0.0571.
  \end{align*} Thus, there is just over a \(5\%\) chance of there being
  \(5\) or more errors on the first page.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

While the most common applications for the Poisson distribution have to
do with the occurrences of events throughout time, it is also possible
to view this as the occurrences of events throughout space. For
instance, if there is a manufacturer producing rope, then the number of
defects in a set length of rope is likely to follow the Poisson
distribution. Similarly, in a set geographic area, the number of birds
of a particular species is likely to follow a Poisson distribution. For
the Poisson distribution, we are typically thinking that there is a rate
at which events of interest occur, and we can use the Poisson
distribution to model the total number of occurrences over some
specified interval.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie find Poisson
Quantities]\protect\hypertarget{exm-poi-dist-list}{}\label{exm-poi-dist-list}

As the last named discrete distribution, Charles and Sadie are excitedly
exploring quantities around them which may be explained by the Poisson
distribution.

For each of the following, help Charles and Sadie provide a
justification of why a Poisson distribution would (or would not be)
appropriate, including a description of the parameter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles got a small injury which required a trip to the emergency
  room. While there, Charles begins to count the number of people that
  arrive over the course of the next hour.
\item
  Sadie, while out exploring birds, decides to count the number of
  cardinals in a particular good viewing spot which is about \(100m^2\)
  in size.
\item
  Charles, while crocheting, realizes that sometimes the yarn in use has
  defects itself. Charles begins to think about the number of defects in
  \(200\) yards of yarn.
\item
  Charles and Sadie are sitting at a public park overlooking the water.
  They start to count the number of boats that pass by over the course
  of the two hours they sit there.
\item
  Sadie starts a blog sharing recipes for baking vegan breads, and
  begins to consider the number of visitors that show up to the site
  each day.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Taking \(X\) to represent the number of individuals arriving to the
  emergency room in the next hour, this will reasonably follow a Poisson
  distribution. The parameter \(\lambda\) would represent the number of
  individuals who arrive per hour, on average. It is counting arrivals
  per hour.
\item
  If Sadie has a sense of the number of cardinals on average per
  \(100m^2\) area, then a Poisson will be appropriate, supposing that
  the birds are fairly uniformly spread out. The parameter \(\lambda\)
  would be the average number of birds in that size of region. It is
  counting occurrences per area.
\item
  If Charles knows the average number of defects per \(200\) yards of
  yarn, then this value can be taken to be \(\lambda\). Supposing that
  the defects occur uniformly, without dependence (e.g., one defect
  makes more likely around it) then a Poisson distribution is
  appropriate. It is counting defects per length of yarn.
\item
  We would take \(\lambda\) to represent the average number of boats in
  a two hour period passing by the location that they are sitting.
  Supposing that these happen independently, at roughly uniform rates,
  then a Poisson is likely appropriate. This would be counting arrivals
  per (two) hour(s).
\item
  If Sadie gets a measure of the average number of visitors per day to
  the website, then setting this to be \(\lambda\) gives a reasonable
  representation of traffic patterns. We would likely want to assume
  that the arrivals are not more on some days (for instance, the
  weekends) than others, but under these assumptions having
  \(X \sim \text{Poi}(\lambda)\) is likely reasonable.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Using Named Distributions}\label{using-named-distributions}

While many other named, discrete distributions exist, these are the most
common. When confronted with a problem in the real-world for which you
wish to understand the uncertainty associated with it, a reasonable
first step is to determine whether a named distribution is well-suited
to representing the underlying phenomenon. Is it a situation with
enumerated events which are equally likely? Use the discrete uniform. Is
it a binary outcome? Use the Bernoulli. Are you counting the number of
success in a fixed number of trials? Use the binomial. Are you running
repeated trials until a (certain number of) success(es)? Use the
geometric (or negative binomial). Are you sampling without replacement?
Use the hypergeometric. Are you counting events over a fixed space? Use
the Poisson.

Once identified, the distribution can be used in exactly the same way as
any probability mass function. That is, we still require all the
probability rules, event descriptions, and techniques from before. The
difference in these cases is that we immediately have access to the
correct form of the probability mass function, the expected value, and
the variance.

An additional utility with this approach to solving probability
questions is that, over time and repeated practice, you can build an
intuition as to the behaviour of random variables following these
various distributions. Probabilities in general can be deeply
unintuitive. It can be hard to assess, without formally working it out,
whether an event is likely or unlikely, let alone how likely an event
is. However, the lack of intuition from our wider experience can be
negated almost entirely by building of intuition through the repeated
application of these distributions. You can start to gain a sense of how
binomial random variables behave, being able to determine just from
inspection whether events seem plausible or not. Much of the study of
probability and statistics is about building a set of tools that can
overcome the flaws in our intuitive reasoning regarding uncertainty.
This comes only through practice, however, this framework of named
distributions provides a very solid foundation to perform such practice.

\subsection{Named Distributions in R}\label{named-distributions-in-r}

In R all of the named distributions that we have discussed, and in fact,
many that we have not discussed, are implemented to make calculations
easier. In particular, there are R functions which evaluate the
probability mass function for the various distributions. Alongside
these, there are also functions which calculate what we refer to as the
\emph{cumulative probability}\footnote{More on this in the coming
  chapter.}, which is to say the \(P(X\leq k)\) for some value \(k\).
These functions generally are called \texttt{d\{distname\}}, where
\texttt{\{distname\}} is the name of the relevant distribution. For
instance, \texttt{dbinom} for the binomial, \texttt{dpoi} for the
Poisson, and so forth. These will evaluate the probability mass function
at the relevant values. In order to evaluate the cumulative probability
at the specified values you would call \texttt{p\{distname\}}. These
functions take in a parameter for the value to evaluate at, and then
parameters that correspond to the various parameters from the
distributions themselves.

Note that we have seen the \texttt{sample} function before, which is an
implementation of the discrete uniform. To implement the Bernoulli, we
can use the binomial distribution with \(n=1\). It is a worthwhile
exercise to see if you can use R to start answering the questions from
this chapter, numerically. This is the first prominent use case for R
programming which can save a tremendous amount of time, and is likely
the first use case that becomes directly relevant to the course
material.

\chapter{Continuous Random Variables}\label{sec-continuous-rv}

Our discussions of probability distributions and their summaries have
focused entirely on discrete random variables. To recap, a discrete
random variable is any random numeric quantity that can take on a
countable number of values. Discrete random variables are defined in
contrast to continuous random variables, which take on values over the
span of intervals in uncountably large sets. Suppose that \(X\) can take
any real number between \(0\) and \(1\). There is no way to enumerate
the set of possible values for this random quantity, and so it must not
be discrete.

Many quantities of interest are better treated as a continuous quantity
rather than a discrete one even when this is not technically correct.
For instance, time measured in seconds is often best thought of as
continuous, even though any stop watch used to grab these measurements
will have some limit to the precision with which they can measure.
Similarly, lengths and heights will often be better treated as
continuous quantities, even though any measuring device will necessarily
have some minimal threshold after which it cannot discern distances.
Thus, deciding whether a quantity is continuous or discrete is sometimes
a judgment call. In general discrete quantities are harder to work with
when the set of possibilities is very large. In these cases, not much is
lost by treating the random variables as though they were continuous.
This distinction is another area which requires the active development
of intuition, but once present, the distinctions become second
nature.\footnote{Recall Example~\ref{exm-discrete-vs-continuous-rv} for
  practice in this.}

\section{Continuous Versus Discrete}\label{continuous-versus-discrete}

Distinguishing whether a random quantity is continuous or discrete is
crucial as, broadly speaking, the two types of quantities are treated
differently. The same underlying ideas are present, but the distinctions
between the two settings require some careful thought. The use of
continuous random variables necessitates an understanding of
introductory calculus. These course notes are designed to be understood
without any experience in calculus, and as a result, we will not spend
much time focusing on continuous random variables. However, continuous
random variables are \emph{the} dominant type of random variables
outside of introductory courses. As a result, understanding the
distinctions, and becoming familiar with how they are to be manipulated
is an important skill.

The key difference between discrete and continuous random variables is
that, for discrete random variables the behaviour is governed by
assessing \(P(X=x)\) for all possible values of \(x\), while for
continuous random variables \(P(X=x)=0\) for \textbf{every} value of
\(x\). This is likely a surprising statement, and as such it is worth
reiterating. With discrete random variables we discussed how all of the
probabilistic behaviour is governed by the probability mass function.
This is defined as \(p_X(x) = P(X=x)\). If \(X\) is a continuous random
variable, we must have \(P(X=x) = 0\). Correspondingly, continuous
random variables do not have probability mass functions, and to
understand the behaviour of these random variables we must us other
quantities.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Singleton Probabilities with Continuous Random Variables}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

While the fact that \(P(X=x) = 0\) may seem unintuitive at first glance,
it is worth exploring this even further. The nature of a continuous
random variable is such that there is no possible way to enumerate all
of the values that are possible to be realized by the random quantity.
Suppose that we take a set of countably many possible observations and
gave each of these a probability of greater than \(0\) of occurring.
Even if we take an infinite number of them, there will still be an
uncountably infinite number of events in the sample space that we have
not accounted for. We know that the total probability of the sample
space must be \(1\), and so we must have the total probability of the
first set of events being less than \(1\)\footnotemark{}.

Now suppose we take another set of countably many events, again giving
each of them a positive probability. Once more the sum of all of these
probabilities must be less than \(1\), and specifically, the sum of both
sets must also be less than \(1\). Even after these two sets, there are
still uncountably infinite events to go and so we continue this process.
Because we always need the total probability to be \(1\) once all events
have been accounted for, and because we will always have uncountably
infinite events remaining to account for, we can \textbf{never} have a
positive probability assigned to each event in a set of events. Even if
we made the probability of each of these sets very, very
small\footnotemark{} after some fixed number of countable events the
probabilities would be greater than \(1\), which cannot happen. As such,
each event itself must have \(0\) probability.

An alternative technique for understanding this intuition is to think
about how unlikely it really would be to observe any specific value.
Suppose that \(X\) takes values on the interval \([0,1]\). Recall that,
when we defined probabilities, we discussed them as being the long run
proportion of time that an event occurs. Take some event, say \(X=0.5\).
Suppose that we took repeated measurements of \(X\) which are
independent and identically distributed. Now suppose that at some point
we exactly do observe \(X=0.5\). Should we expect that this will ever
happen again? The next time we get near \(0.5\), might we instead
observe \(0.51\) or \(0.49\) or \(0.5000000000000000001\) or any of the
other uncountably infinite values in the very near vicinity of \(0.5\)?
Each time that we make an observation the denominator of our proportion
is growing, but if every value between \(0\) and \(1\) is truly
possible, as time goes on the number of times that \(X=0.5\) must stay
much, much smaller than the total number of trials. If we continue this
off to infinity, in the limit, the probability must become \(0\).

This conclusion leads to a few different points. First, impossibility is
not the same as probability \(0\). Impossible events do have probability
\(0\), but possible events may also have probability \(0\). Events which
are outside of the sample space are impossible. Events inside the sample
space, even probability zero events, remain possible. Second, we require
alternative mathematical tools for discussing the probability of events
in a continuous setting. Ideally this would be analogous to a
probability mass function, but would somehow function in the case of
continuity.

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{If it summed to \(1\) then this would not be a continuous
random variable, since there would only be a countable number of
possible events.}

\footnotetext{Like, \(1\) in a million, or \(1\) in a billion, or \(1\)
in the number of atoms in the universe.}

\section{Cumulative Distribution
Functions}\label{cumulative-distribution-functions}

To begin building to the continuous analogue of the probability mass
function, we will start by focusing on events that are easier to define
in the continuous case. Suppose that \(X\) is defined on some continuous
interval. Instead of thinking of events relating to \(X=x\), we instead
turn our focus to events of the form \(X \in (a,b)\) for some interval
defined by the endpoints \(a\) and \(b\). Now note that, relying only on
our knowledge of probabilities relating to generic events, we can
rewrite \(P(X\in(a,b))\) slightly. Specifically, \begin{align*}
P(X\in(a,b)) &= 1 - P(X\not\in(a,b))\\
&= 1 - P(\{X < a\}\cup\{X > b\}) \\
&= 1 - \left(P(X < a) + P(X > b)\right)\\
&= 1 - P(X > b) - P(X < a)\\
&= P(X < b) - P(X < a).\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-number-line}A number line showcasing the interval
\((a,b)\) and demonstrating how you can take everything less than \(b\)
and remove all that is less than \(a\) to be left with only \((a,b)\).}

\centering{

\includegraphics{graphics/ch9-difference-in-numbers.png}

}

\end{figure}%

In words we know that the probability that \(X\) falls into any
particular interval is given by the probability that it is less than the
upper bound of the interval minus the probability that it is less than
the lower bound of the interval. Notice that \(X < a\) is an event, and
if we knew how to assign probabilities to \(X<a\) for arbitrary \(a\),
then we could assign probabilities to any interval. Also note that, even
in the continuous case, it make sense to talk of \(P(X < a)\) for some
value \(a\). These intervals will contain an uncountably infinite number
of events, and as such, can certainly occur with greater than \(0\)
probability.

Consider an example with \(X\) defined on \([0,1]\). In this case we
know that \(P(X<1)=1\). Note that we could have written
\(P(X \leq 1) = 1\), which may have been more obviously true. However,
\(P(X\leq 1) = P(\{X<1\}\cup\{X=1\}) = P(X<1) + P(X=1)\) and we know
that \(P(X=1)=0\). In the continuous case we do not need to worry
whether we use \(X\leq a\) or \(X < a\), and we will interchange them
throughout.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Wait for the
Bus]\protect\hypertarget{exm-charles-and-sadie-bus-times}{}\label{exm-charles-and-sadie-bus-times}

Charles and Sadie are visiting a large city and are getting around via
public transit while there. They are not quite familiar with the bus
schedules yet, but they know that the bus they are waiting for will show
up sometime in the next \(15\) minutes. They realize that this is a
continuous random quantity, and decide to pass the time by trying to
reason about how long they will be waiting for the bus to arrive. To do
so, they make the assumption that the bus is equally likely to show at
any point during this interval.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait \(15\) or fewer
  minutes for the bus?
\item
  What is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait \(5\) or fewer
  minutes for the bus?
\item
  What is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait exactly \(7\)
  minutes for the bus?
\item
  What is the probability that Charles and Sadie wait between \(8\) and
  \(12\) minutes for the bus?
\item
  What is the probability that Charles and Sadie have to wait longer
  than \(13\) minutes for the bus?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Let \(X\) represent the amount of time that they wait for the bus.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If we trust their judgment, then they have claimed that they will wait
  between \(0\) and \(15\) minutes for the bus. As a result,
  \(P(X \leq 15) = 1\).
\item
  Here we can reason that if any time is equally likely for the bus to
  arrive, then the first \(5\) minutes must be as likely as the second
  interval of \(5\) minutes or the third. That is, in the first \(5\)
  minutes there is a total of \(\dfrac{5}{15} = \dfrac{1}{3}\) of the
  possible arrival times taken up, and so we must conclude that
  \(P(X \leq 5) = \dfrac{1}{3}\).
\item
  This would be \(P(X = 7)\). \(X\) is a continuous quantity, and so
  \(P(X = 7) = 0\).
\item
  We can reason through this in two different ways. First, we can use
  the property discussed above that
  \(P(X \in (8, 12)) = P(X \leq 12) - P(X\leq 8)\), and then use the
  same procedure as in (b). That gives
  \[P(X \in (8, 12)) = \dfrac{12}{15} - \dfrac{8}{15} = \dfrac{4}{15}.\]
  Alternatively, because each interval of the same length must be
  equally likely, we can reason that this is just a length \(4\)
  interval. Thus, it must have the same likelihood as any other length
  \(4\) interval, given by \(\dfrac{4}{15}\).
\item
  Note that, longer than \(13\) is the complement to less than \(13\).
  Thus,
  \[P(X \geq 13) = 1 - P(X \leq 13) = 1 - \dfrac{13}{15} = \dfrac{2}{15}.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

The centrality of events of the form \(X \leq a\) prompts the definition
of a mathematical function which we call the \textbf{cumulative
distribution function}.

\begin{definition}[Cumulative Distribution
Function]\protect\hypertarget{def-cdf}{}\label{def-cdf}

The cumulative distribution function of a random variable \(X\),
typically denoted as \(F(x)\) or \(F_X(x)\), is defined as the function
that gives the probability that the random variable is less than or
equal to some threshold. That is, \(F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)\). We may also
refer to the cumulative distribution function simply as the
\textbf{distribution function}.

\end{definition}

Once we have defined the distribution function for a random variable,
using the above derivation we are able to determine the probability
associated with any events based on intervals. It is worth noting that
the cumulative distribution function can also be defined for discrete
random variables. In the case of a discrete random variable, we would
have \[F_X(x) = \sum_{k \in\mathcal{X}; k \leq x} p_X(k).\] Since it is
simply the summation of the probability mass function it tends to be a
less useful quantity.

Suppose that, for a random variable \(X\), we know the cumulative
distribution function. This knowledge permits the computation of
\emph{any} probability associated with the random variable. Consider
some event defined in terms of \(X\) which we may wish to determine the
probability of. We know that events are subsets of the sample space.
Every one of these events can be written using our basic set operations
(unions, intersections, and complements) applied to intervals of the
form \((a,b)\) and sets of the form \(\{x\}\).\footnote{These are called
  singletons. We addressed these in terms of probability assignment
  using the language of singletons above. As a general rule, when
  working with continuous quantities, we simply ignore all of the
  singletons.} The axioms of probability allow us to compute
probabilities across the set operations. Further, our knowledge of the
cumulative distribution function, the conversion of \(P(X \in (a,b))\)
into \(F_X(b) - F_X(a)\), and the fact that \(P(X=x) = 0\) for all \(x\)
gives all of the results we need to derive probabilities for these
events.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie's Light
Bulbs]\protect\hypertarget{exm-lightbulb-cdf}{}\label{exm-lightbulb-cdf}

Charles and Sadie decide that they need to replace some light bulbs. In
their research online, a particular manufacturer of light bulbs,
\emph{Bayesian Brights}, lists the cumulative distribution function for
the lifetime of their bulbs, in hours. The model Charles and Sadie are

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Using the given cumulative distribution function this can be
  calculated as
  \[P(X \leq 5000) = F(5000) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{5000}{10000}\right) = 1 - e^{-1/2} \approx 0.39346934.\]
\item
  Here we get
  \begin{multline*}P(X \in (7500,12000)) = P(X \leq 12000) - P(X\leq 7500) = F(12000) - F(7500) \\
  = \exp\left(-0.75\right) - \exp\left(-1.2\right) \approx 0.171172341.\end{multline*}
\item
  We can convert this to be the complement event so that it is
  expressible in terms of the cumulative distribution function. That is,
  \(P(X \geq 8000) = 1 - P(X \leq 8000)\), and so
  \[P(X \geq 8000) = 1 - F(8000) = 1 - (1 - e^{-0.8}) = e^{-0.8} \approx 0.449328964.\]

\section{The Probability Density
Function}\label{the-probability-density-function}

The distribution function will be the core object used to discuss the
probabilistic behaviour of a continuous random variable. All of the
behaviour of these random quantities will be described by the
distribution function, and as such we will take the distribution
function as a function which defines the distribution of a continuous
random quantity. This is all that we need in order to analyze these
random variables, however, it may be a little unsatisfying in contrast
with the discrete case.

We had set out to find a quantity that paralleled the probability mass
function. Instead, we concluded that the cumulative distribution
function can be made to play the same role in terms of describing the
behaviour of the random quantity. Still, it may be of interest for us to
have a function which takes into account the \emph{relative likelihood}
of being near some value. Suppose, for instance, that for a random
variable defined on \([0,1]\) we wanted to know how likely it was to be
in the vicinity of \(X=0.5\). We could take a small number, say
\(\delta = 0.01\) and calculate
\[P(X\in(0.5-\delta,0.5+\delta)) = F(0.5+\delta)-F(0.5-\delta).\] This
is perfectly well defined based on our discussions to this point. Now,
suppose that \(\delta\) is small enough so that it is reasonable to
assume that this probability is fairly evenly distributed throughout the
interval. Then, if we wanted to assign a likelihood to each value, we
could divide this total probability by the length of the interval,
\(2\delta\). As a result, in this case, the probability that \(X\) is
nearly \(0.5\) will be approximately given by the expression
\[\dfrac{F(0.5+\delta)-F(0.5-\delta)}{2\delta}.\]

We had taken \(\delta=0.01\), but the same process could be applied for
smaller and smaller \(\delta\), say \(0.001\) or \(0.0001\).
Intuitively, as the size of this interval shrinks more and more we are
getting a better and better estimate for the likelihood that the random
variable is in the immediate vicinity of \(0.5\). Moreover, as
\(\delta\) gets smaller and smaller our assumption of a uniform
probability over the interval becomes more and more reasonable.
Unfortunately, we cannot set \(\delta=0\), exactly. We can ask what
happens \emph{in the limit} as \(\delta\) continues to get smaller and
smaller. This question is in the purview of calculus, and can in fact be
answered. While working out the answer is beyond the scope of the
course, we will provide the result anyway.\footnote{If you have taken
  calculus, you may recognize this process as feeling related to the
  first principle definition of a derivative. While it is often
  described in a slightly different way, this feeling of connection is
  intentional.} The resulting function is called the \textbf{probability
density function}, and is related to the cumulative distribution
function through derivatives (and integrals).

\begin{definition}[Probability Density
Function]\protect\hypertarget{def-probability-density-function}{}\label{def-probability-density-function}

A random variable \(X\), with cumulative distribution function \(F(x)\),
is further characterized by its probability density function, denoted
\(f(x)\). The density function describes the relative likelihood of a
random variable taking on values in a particular interval, and mirrors
the behaviour of the probability mass function in the discrete case.
Formally, the probability density function is equal to the derivative of
the cumulative distribution function.

\end{definition}

Roughly speaking, the density function evaluates how likely it is for a
continuous quantity to be in a small neighbourhood of the given value.
Critically, \textbf{probability density functions do not give
probabilities directly}. In fact, probability density functions may give
values that are greater than \(1\)!\footnote{This is not a rare
  occurrence either. For instance, if we consider a random variable that
  will take on values in the interval \([0,0.5]\) with equal likelihood,
  the probability density function in this case will be \(f(x) = 2\).}
Still, if we see the shape of the probability density function, we can
state how likely it is to make observations near the results of
interest. We will often graph the density functions. The high points of
the graph indicate regions with more probability than the regions of the
graph which are lower. Again, the specific probability of any event
\(X=x\) will always be \(0\), but some events fall in neighbourhoods
which are more likely to observe than others.\footnote{Think about the
  fact that, while we may think of human adult heights as a continuous
  quantity, it is far more likely to observe a height around \(5\) feet
  \(6\) inches than around \(9\) feet \(2\) inches.}

\begin{example}[The Types of Busses in the
City]\protect\hypertarget{exm-bus-trips-two}{}\label{exm-bus-trips-two}

After returning from their trip to the big city, Charles and Sadie are
talking to their friend Garth, with a lot more experience in the matter.
Garth explains that there are actually several different types of
busses, with different arrival schedules over the \(15\) minute
interval. Knowing that Charles and Sadie have started to learn about
probability density functions, Garth draws out the following sketch,
giving the probability density function for three different busses.

\includegraphics{notes/chapter9_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Which of the three buses is most likely to show up around the \(1\)
  minute mark?
\item
  Which of the three buses is most likely to show up around the \(6\)
  minute mark?
\item
  Which of the three buses is most likely to show up around the \(14\)
  minute mark?
\item
  Which bus is most likely to show up at \(10\) minutes exactly?
\item
  During which intervals would each of the buses be more likely than the
  other two to arrive?
\item
  Describe the behaviour of each of the three buses.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  At \(x = 1\), the black density is higher than the red density which
  is higher than the blue density. This gives the relative ranking that
  arrivals around \(1\) minute or more likely for the black bus than red
  or blue.
\item
  At \(x = 6\), the blue density is higher than the red or black
  densities, which are roughly the same, and as such, it is the most
  likely bus to arrive in the vicinity of \(6\) minutes.
\item
  At \(14\), the red density is higher than the black density which is
  higher than the blue. This gives the relative ordering of likelihood
  of arrivals.
\item
  All buses have probability \(0\) of arriving at \(10\) minutes exactly
  since these are the densities for continuous random variables.
\item
  The black bus is most likely to arrive for times up until around \(4\)
  minutes, where the blue bus is then the most likely to arrive until
  around \(11\) minutes, where the red bus is most likely to arrive
  until the \(15\) minute mark.
\item
  The red bus has an equal probability of arriving across the full
  interval. The black bus is more likely to arrive near the start of the
  interval, slowly decaying in likelihood as time goes on, while
  remaining fairly likely at the \(15\) minute mark. The blue bus is
  very unlikely to take a very short period of time, or a very long
  period of time, and far more likely to sit in the middle of the
  possible interval.
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\section{Using Continuous
Distributions}\label{using-continuous-distributions}

With the exception of the previously indicated differences, continuous
and discrete random variables are treated similarly. The tools to
analyze them differ\footnote{In the continuous case we cannot sum over
  the sample space, and so we must use techniques from calculus to
  mirror this process, for instance.}, but the fundamentals remain the
same. It is possible to compute expected values, medians, and modes,
with roughly the same interpretations. It is possible to describe the
range, interquartile range, and variance, with similar interpretations.
The axioms of probability still underpin the manipulation and analysis
of these random variables. The distinction is merely that in, place of
elementary mathematics to complete the calculations, calculus is
required.

Just as with discrete distributions, there are named continuous
distributions. These are typically governed by either a density function
or cumulative distribution function, alongside the expected value and
variance. Just like the named discrete distributions, by matching the
underlying scenario to the correct process we are able to avoid a lot of
work in understanding the behaviour of the random quantities. Now,
because calculus is not assumed knowledge, we will not work too widely
with continuous random variables. We will introduce only two named
continuous distributions: the uniform distribution\footnote{Which we
  have actually already seen.} and the normal distribution.\footnote{Which
  is far and away the most important distribution (discrete or
  continuous) in all of probability and statistics.}

\section{The Uniform Distribution}\label{the-uniform-distribution}

The uniform distribution\footnote{Sometimes called the continuous
  uniform distribution to distinguish it from its discrete counterpart.}
is parameterized over an interval specified as \((a,b)\). On this
interval, equal probability density is given to every event, which is to
say that the density function is constant. Specifically, if
\(X\sim\text{Unif}(a,b)\) then
\[f(x) = \begin{cases}\frac{1}{b-a} & x \in (a,b) \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]
From the density function we can find that
\[F(x) = \frac{x - a}{b - a}\] for \(x \in (a,b)\), with \(F(x) = 0\)
for \(x < a\) and \(F(x) = 1\) for \(x > b\). Moreover, we have
\(E[X] = \frac{a+b}{2}\) and \(\text{var}(X) = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\).

\begin{example}[Characterizing the Wait
Time]\protect\hypertarget{exm-charles-and-sadie-bus-times-expected}{}\label{exm-charles-and-sadie-bus-times-expected}

Still considering the wait time for buses in the city, Sadie points out
that the bus they were waiting for follows a \(\text{Unif}(0,15)\)
distribution. They can use their newfound wisdom to make deeper
conclusions about the process!\footnote{In
  Example~\ref{exm-charles-and-sadie-bus-times} we implicitly used the
  cumulative distribution function of the uniform. It is worth
  revisiting these probabilities \emph{knowing} that this is the case.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How long should they expect to wait for the bus?
\item
  What is the variance for the amount of time that they will be waiting?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Here, we know that \(X\sim\text{Unif}(0,15)\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(E[X]\) is \(\dfrac{a+b}{2} = \dfrac{0+15}{2} = 7.5\), so they should
  expect to wait \(7.5\) minutes.
\item
  The variance is \(\text{var}(X) = \dfrac{(15 - 0)^2}{12} = 18.75\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

The uniform distribution is analogous to the discrete uniform. Any time
there is an interval of possible outcomes which are all equally likely,
the uniform distribution is the distribution to use. Compared with other
distributions it is also fairly straightforward to work with, which
makes it a useful demonstration of the concepts relating the continuous
probability calculations.\footnote{For instance, in
  Example~\ref{exm-geometric}, we implicitly used a continuous uniform
  distribution to give the probability that Charles hits the dartboard.
  This type of reasoning is very prevalent.}

\section{The Normal Distribution}\label{the-normal-distribution}

The normal distribution, also sometimes referred to as the Gaussian
distribution, is a named continuous distribution function defined on the
complete real line. The distribution is far and away the most
prominently used distribution in all of probability and statistics. In
fact, most people have heard of normal distributions even if they are
not aware of this fact. Any time that there is a discussion of a bell
curve, for instance, this is in reference to the normal distribution.
Normally distributed quantities arise all over the place from
measurements of heights, grades, or reaction times through to levels of
job satisfaction, reading ability, or blood pressure. There is a
tremendous number of normally distributed phenomena naturally occurring
in the world, which renders the normal distribution deeply important
across a wide range of domains.

Perhaps more important than the places where the normal distribution
arises in nature are the places where it arises mathematically. At the
end of this course we will see a result, \emph{the central limit
theorem}, which is one of the core results in all of statistics. Much of
the statistical theory that drives scientific inquiry sits atop the
central limit theorem. And at the core of the central limit theorem is
the normal distribution. It is virtually impossible to overstate the
importance of the normal distribution, and as a result, it is worthy of
investigation.

\subsection{The Specification of the
Distribution}\label{the-specification-of-the-distribution}

A normal distribution is parameterized by two parameters: the mean,
\(\mu\), and the variance \(\sigma^2\). We write
\(X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\). These parameters directly correspond to the
relevant quantities such that \(E[X] = \mu\) and
\(\text{var}(X) = \sigma^2\). The density function is given by
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).\]
This can be quite unwieldy to work with, however, when it is plotted we
see that the normal distribution takes on a bell curve which is centered
at \(\mu\).

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-normal-density}Three normal distribution densities
plotted with mean 0 (red and blue), and mean 5 (black). The red density
has variance 1, the blue density has variance 4, and the black density
has variance 0.25.}

\centering{

\includegraphics{notes/chapter9_files/figure-pdf/fig-normal-density-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{The Standard Normal
Distribution}\label{the-standard-normal-distribution}

Normally distributed random variables are particularly well-behaved. One
way in which this is true is that if you multiply a normally distributed
random variable by a constant, it will remain normally distributed, and
if you add a constant to a normally distributed random variable, it will
remain normally distributed. Consider, for \(X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\),
taking the \(X - \mu\). From our discussions of expected values we know
that \(E[X-\mu] = E[X]-\mu = 0\). Furthermore, adding or subtracting a
constant will not change the variance. Thus,
\(X-\mu\sim N(0,\sigma^2)\).

Now, consider dividing this by \(\sigma\), or equivalently, multiply by
\(\dfrac{1}{\sigma}\). The expected value of the new quantity will be
\(\dfrac{1}{\sigma}\times 0 = 0\), and, from our discussions regarding
the variance of linear transformations, the variance of the new quantity
will be \(\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\times\sigma^2 = 1\). Taken together then,
if \(X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\),
\[Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1).\] This holds true for
\emph{any} normal distribution with \emph{any} mean or variance values.
This straightforward transformation allows us to discuss normal
distributions in terms of \(N(0,1)\). We call this the \textbf{standard
normal distribution}, and will typically use \(Z\) to denote a random
variable from the standard normal distribution.

\begin{definition}[Standard Normal
Distribution]\protect\hypertarget{def-standard-normal}{}\label{def-standard-normal}

The standard normal distribution is the version of the normal
distribution with mean \(0\) and variance \(1\). We say that \(Z\)
follows a standard normal, and write \(Z\sim N(0,1)\), if the density of
\(Z\) is given by
\[f_Z(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{z^2}{2}\right).\] We
denote the density of \(Z\) as \(\varphi(z)\), and the cumulative
distribution function of \(Z\) as \(\Phi(z)\). The cumulative
distribution function, \(\Phi(z)\), does not have a nice form to be
written down, however, it is a commonly applied enough function that
many computing languages have implemented it, including of course
R.\footnote{See Section~\ref{sec-r-normal} for more details on this.}

\end{definition}

The utility in this process of converting normally distributed random
variables to be standard normal random variables, a process known as
\textbf{standardization}, is demonstrated by realizing that events can
be converted using the same transformations. Specifically, suppose we
have \(X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\), and we want to find \(P(X \leq x)\).
Note that, \(X \leq x\) must also mean that
\[\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma},\] through an
application of the same transformation to both sides. But we \emph{know}
that the left hand side of this inequality is exactly \(Z\), a standard
normal random variable with cumulative distribution function
\(\Phi(z)\). Thus,
\[P(X \leq x) = P\left(Z \leq \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right) = \Phi\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right).\]
Using this trick of standardization any normal probability can be
converted into a probability regarding the standard normal.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Explore House
Plants]\protect\hypertarget{exm-standardization-example}{}\label{exm-standardization-example}

Charles and Sadie learn that the heights of fully grown house plants are
often normally distributed. They are exploring which plants will work
best in their new apartment, but are finding it difficult to reason
about them in comparison to one another. Some plants end up being taller
on average with a lot more variability, while others may be shorter but
far more certain. Sadie realizes that the cumulative distribution
function of a standard normal, \(\Phi(z)\), can be evaluated using their
smart phones. As a result, they get to work expressing different
probabilities in terms of \(\Phi(z)\).

They are comparing four different plant species. These species have
heights according to the following random variables.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Plant \(A\) has height \(X\), which follows a normal distribution with
  mean \(90\) and variance \(100\).
\item
  Plant \(B\) has height \(Y\), which follows a \(N(110, 400)\)
  distribution.
\item
  Plant \(C\) has height \(V\), which follows a normal distribution
  centered on \(70\) with standard deviation \(7\).
\item
  Plant \(D\) has height \(W\), which follows a normal distribution with
  \(\mu=85\) and \(\sigma^2 = 81\).
\end{enumerate}

Express each of the following probabilities in terms of \(\Phi(z)\), the
cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One spot the plants cannot be too tall. What is the probability that
  they can fit plant \(A\) into a spot which cannot accommodate plants
  taller than \(80\)cm?
\item
  A second spot would be strange to have too short of a plant in. If
  they require the plant to be at least \(125\)cm, what is the
  probability they can use plant \(B\)?
\item
  A third spot can accommodate plants that are either under \(60\)cm if
  they use a stand, or else over \(90\)cm. How likely is it that plant
  \(C\) will work in this spot?
\item
  A fourth spot requires a plant that is somewhere between \(80\)cm and
  \(90\)cm. What is the probability that plant \(D\) will work?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Here we wish to standard a \(N(90, 100)\) random variable. To do this
  we note that
  \[\frac{X-90}{\sqrt{100}} = \frac{X - 90}{10} \sim N(0,1).\] Thus,
  taking \(Z \sim N(0,1)\), we know that
  \[P(X \leq 80) = P\left(\frac{X - 90}{10} \leq \frac{80 - 90}{10}\right) = P(Z \leq -1) = \Phi(-1).\]
\item
  Here we wish to standard a \(N(110, 400)\) random variable. To do this
  we note that
  \[\frac{Y-110}{\sqrt{400}} = \frac{Y - 110}{20} \sim N(0,1).\] Thus,
  taking \(Z \sim N(0,1)\), we know that
  \[P(Y \geq 125) = P\left(\frac{Y - 110}{20} \geq \frac{125 - 110}{20}\right) = P(Z \geq \frac{3}{4}) = 1 - \Phi(0.75).\]
\item
  Here we wish to standard a \(N(70, 49)\) random variable. To do this
  we note that \[\frac{V-70}{7} \sim N(0,1).\] Thus, taking
  \(Z \sim N(0,1)\), we know that
  \[P(V \leq 60) = P\left(\frac{V - 70}{7} \leq \frac{60 - 70}{7}\right) = P(Z \leq -\frac{10}{7}) = \Phi(-\frac{10}{7}).\]
  Moreover, we know that
  \[P(V \geq 90) = P\left(\frac{V - 70}{7} \geq \frac{90 - 70}{7}\right) = P(Z \geq \frac{20}{7}) = 1 - \Phi(\frac{20}{7}).\]
  Thus, the probability this will be acceptable will be
  \(1 - \Phi(\frac{20}{7}) + \Phi(-\frac{10}{7})\).
\item
  Here we wish to standard a \(N(85, 81)\) random variable. To do this
  we note that
  \[\frac{W-85}{\sqrt{81}} = \frac{W - 85}{9} \sim N(0,1).\] Thus,
  taking \(Z \sim N(0,1)\), we know that
  \begin{multline*}P(80 \leq W \leq 90) = P\left(\frac{80 - 85}{9} \leq \frac{W - 85}{9} \leq \frac{90 - 85}{9}\right) \\ = P(Z \leq \frac{5}{9}) - P(Z \leq -\frac{5}{9}) = \Phi(\frac{5}{9}) - \Phi(-\frac{5}{9}).\end{multline*}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

As a result, combining our knowledge of continuous random variables,
with the process of standardization we are able to calculate normal
probabilities for any events relating to normally distributed random
quantities. Moreover, since the shape of the normal distribution is so
predictable, it is often easy to draw out the density function, and
indicate on this graphic the probabilities of interest, which in turn
helps with the required probability calculations. Calculating
probabilities from normal distributions remains a central component of
working with statistics and probabilities beyond this course. Developing
the skills and intuition at this point, through repeated practice is a
key step in successfully navigating statistics here and beyond.

When you have access to a computer, and your interest is in calculating
a normal probability, as described above, there is not typically a need
for standardization. However, it remains an important skill for several
reasons. First, by always working with the same normal distribution, you
will develop a much more refined intuition for the likelihoods of
different events. It goes beyond working with the same family of
distributions, you get very used to working with exactly the same
distribution. Second, you will likely become quite familiar with certain
key \textbf{critical values} of the standard normal distribution. These
values arise frequently, and allow you to quickly approximate the
likelihood of different events. Finally, as we begin to move away from
studying probability and into studying statistics, the standard normal
will feature prominently there.

\subsection{Normal Probability Calculations in R}\label{sec-r-normal}

Just as with the named discrete distributions, R provides functions for
calculating probabilities related to normal random variables. The
relevant functions are the \texttt{dnorm} and \texttt{pnorm} function,
for the density function and the cumulative distribution function,
respectively. These functions can take arguments for the mean and
standard deviation\footnote{Recall, the standard deviation is the square
  root of the variance.} of the normal. If not provided, it will default
to the standard normal.

\subsection{The Empirical Rule and Chebyshev's
Inequality}\label{the-empirical-rule-and-chebyshevs-inequality}

Another way in which the normal distribution is well behaved is
summarized in the \textbf{emprical rule}. The shape of the distribution
is such that, no matter the specific mean or variance, all members of
the family remain quite similar. This enables the derivation of an easy,
approximate result, to help intuitively gauge the probabilities of
normal events.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={The Empirical Rule}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

The empirical rule is a mathematical result regarding the probability of
a normally distributed random variable. If \(X\) has a normal
distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\), then:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability of observing a value within \(\sigma\) of the mean is
  approximately \(0.68\);
\item
  The probability of observing a value within \(2\sigma\) of the mean is
  approximately \(0.95\); and
\item
  The probability of observing a value within \(3\sigma\) of the mean is
  approximately \(0.997\).
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics{notes/chapter9_files/figure-pdf/empirical_rule-1.pdf}

\end{tcolorbox}

In words, the empirical states that almost all of the observations from
a normal distribution will fall in the interval \(\mu\pm3\sigma\). In
mathematical terms, the empirical rule is summarized as \begin{align*}
    P(\mu-\sigma\leq X \leq \mu + \sigma) &\approx 0.68 \\ 
    P(\mu - 2\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 2\sigma) &\approx 0.95 \\ 
    P(\mu - 3\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 3\sigma) &\approx 0.997. 
\end{align*} With the standard normal we can replace \(\mu\) with \(0\),
and \(\sigma\) with \(1\) to get a version which is slightly more
concise to state. It is then possible to combine these different
intervals by recognizing the symmetry in the normal distribution. That
is, \(P(\mu \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma) \approx \dfrac{0.68}{2} = 0.34\).

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Can Never Have Enough House
Plants]\protect\hypertarget{exm-empirical-rule-calc}{}\label{exm-empirical-rule-calc}

Their standardization efforts paid off, and Charles and Sadie found some
plants that should fit the spaces that they need once they've grown up.
Because of how well the plants worked out, they wanted to buy some more.
They end up back at the store, and they know that they need to get a
plant that will grow to be between \(70\)cm and \(106\)cm. They have
several options for plants again:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A plant with heights \(X\) according to \(N(88, 36)\).
\item
  A plant with heights \(Y\) according to \(N(124, 324)\).
\item
  A plant with heights \(W\) according to \(N(82, 144)\).
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately, Charles and Sadie forget their phones at home and so they
cannot make direct calculations using \(\Phi(z)\). Can you help them,
without using a normal probability calculator, determine which plant has
the highest probability of being acceptable?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Without access to \(\Phi(z)\) we can instead make use of the empirical
rule. Consider that for \(X\) we have \(\mu_X = 88\) and
\(\sigma = \sqrt{36} = 6\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If we take the interval \([70, 106]\) then we can consider the terms
  \[\frac{70-88}{6} = \frac{-18}{6} = -3 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{106-88}{6} = 3.\]
  Thus,
  \(P(70 \leq X \leq 106) = P(\mu_X - 3\sigma_X \leq X \leq \mu_X + 3\sigma_X)\).
  Using the empirical rule we know that this probability is
  approximately \(0.997\).
\item
  We can approach the same tactics for \(Y\). This time, we get
  \[\frac{70-124}{\sqrt{324}} = -3 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{106-124}{18} = -1\].
  Thus,
  \(P(70 \leq Y \leq 106) = P(\mu_Y - 3\sigma_Y \leq Y \leq \mu_Y - \sigma_Y)\).
  Note that from \(\mu\) to \(\mu-3\sigma\), according the empirical
  rule, there is \(\dfrac{0.997}{2} = 0.4985\) probability. Similarly,
  according to the empirical rule there is \(\dfrac{0.68}{2} = 0.34\)
  probability of being between \(\mu\) and \(\mu-\sigma\). Thus, if we
  take \(0.4985 - 0.34 = 0.1585\), this gives the probability of being
  between \(\mu-3\sigma\) and \(\mu-\sigma\), as required.
\item
  As above,
  \[\frac{70-82}{\sqrt{144}} = -1 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{106-82}{12} = 2\].
  As a result,
  \(P(70 \leq W \leq 106) = P(\mu_W - \sigma_W \leq W \leq \mu_W + 2\sigma_W)\).
  Note that as in (2) there is \(0.34\) probability of being between
  \(\mu\) and \(\mu-\sigma\). To be between \(\mu\) and
  \(\mu + 2\sigma\) there will be probability
  \(\dfrac{0.95}{2} = 0.475\). As a result, the total probability here
  will be \(0.34 + 0.475 = 0.815\).
\end{enumerate}

As a result, the first plant has a \(0.997\) chance to fit, the second a
\(0.1585\), and the third a \(0.815\) (approximately).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

The empirical rule is not exact, and when computing probabilities with
access to statistical software it is likely of limited direct utility.
However, it is another tool to leverage to continue refining your
intuition for the behaviour of random quantities. It is also a good
``check'' to have, giving an immediate sense of the likelihood of
different events. If you compute an answer which seems to contradict the
empirical rule, take a second look. If you have someone tell you that
they have observed events which are out of line with the empirical rule,
be skeptical.

The empirical rule is a useful result to aid in building intuition
regarding the normal distribution. However, when quantities are not
normally distributed, it does not apply. A related, though somewhat
weaker result is Chebyshev's Inequality. This will hold for \emph{any}
distribution, and can be seen as a useful extension to the empirical
rule.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Chebyshev's Inequality}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Chebyshev's Inequality provides probabilistic bounds on the likelihood
of deviating from the mean for any random variable. In words, there is a
probability of \(0.75\) or more of observing an observation within two
standard deviations, and a probability of at least \(0.8889\) of
observing a value within three standard deviations of the mean.
Formally, for any \(k > 0\),
\[P(\mu - k\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + k\sigma) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}.\]

\end{tcolorbox}

Here \(k\) can be any real number which is greater than \(0\). If
\(k\leq 1\), this result is uninteresting since the bound simply is
\(0\). However, taking \(k=2\) gives the \(0.75\) lower bound outlined
above, which is a more useful result. Additionally, there is no
requirement for \(k\) to be an integer here, and so, for instance, the
probability of observing a value within \(\mu\pm\sqrt{2}\sigma\) is at
least \(0.5\), for all distributions.

\begin{example}[Fitting in the Strange
Plants]\protect\hypertarget{exm-chebyshevs-ineqaulity}{}\label{exm-chebyshevs-ineqaulity}

Charles and Sadie selected a plant to fit in the spot requiring one
between \(70\) and \(106\)cm. However, as they are checking out at the
store they see a plant that they like much better. They are conflicted
since they do not know whether this plant will satisfy normality
assumptions in its height. The worker tells them that on average the
plant grows to be \(88\)cm, and figures that the variance will be
approximately \(51.84\). Charles and Sadie want to be at least \(90\%\)
certain that the plant will fit. If they are, they will buy it!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If they assume that the plants heights are normally distributed,
  should they buy the plant?
\item
  If they do not assume that the plants heights are normally
  distributed, should they buy the plant?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that in this case, we have a mean of \(88\) and a standard
  deviation of \(7.2\). As a result, we have that \(70\) is
  \(\mu - 2.5\sigma\) and \(106\) is \(\mu + 2.5\sigma\). The empirical
  rule does not tell us directly how to address probabilities in this
  case, however, we know that
  \[P(X \in [\mu-2\sigma, \mu+2\sigma]) \leq P(X \in [\mu - 2.5\sigma, \mu+2.5\sigma]) \leq P(X \in [\mu-3\sigma,\mu+3\sigma]).\]
  According to the empirical rule then we can say that, if this plant
  follows a normal distribution, the probability it is accessible will
  be between \(0.95\) and \(0.997\). If the normal distribution is a
  reasonable assumption, then they should buy the plant.
\item
  If the distribution is non-normal, then we can instead apply
  Chebyshev's inequality. Here we have \(k=2.5\), as solved for in (a).
  As a result,
  \[P(\mu - 2.5\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 2.5\sigma) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{(2.5)^2} = 0.84.\]
  As a result, if they want to be \(90\%\) certain, without knowing more
  about the distribution they should \emph{not} purchase the plant.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Closure of the Normal
Distribution}\label{closure-of-the-normal-distribution}

We have seen a certain type of \emph{closure property} for the normal
distribution when we discussed standardization. That is, adding and
multiplying by constants does not change the distribution when working
with normally distributed quantities. This is an interesting property
which does not hold for most distributions, and makes normally
distributed random variables quite nice to work with. The normal
distribution has an additional type of closure property which is
frequently used.

Suppose that \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, with
\(X\sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)\), and \(Y\sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)\). In
this setting, \[X+Y\sim N(\mu_X+\mu_Y, \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2).\] That
is to say, the addition of two independent normally distributed random
variables will also be normally distributed. This extends beyond two in
the natural way, simply by applying and reapplying the rule (as many
times as is required).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, toptitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, title={Closure of the Normal Distribution}, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm]

Suppose that \(X_1, \dots, X_n\) are all independent, with each
\(X_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)\). Then the summation
\[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2),\] where
\(\mu = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i\) and \(\sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2\).
Notably, if \(X_1,\dots,X_n \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu,\sigma^2)\), then
the summation will be \(N(n\mu, n\sigma^2)\).

\end{tcolorbox}

If instead of considering the summation, we consider the average of
\(n\) independent and identically distributed \(N(\mu,\sigma^2)\)
variables, then
\[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}).\] This
follows from an application of our standard expectation and variance
transformation rules. This type of result is central to the practice of
statistics, and this closure under addition further aids in the utility
of the normal distribution.

\section{Approximations Using the Normal
Distribution}\label{approximations-using-the-normal-distribution}

A final utility to the normal distribution is in its ability to
approximate other distributions. While several of these approximations
exist, we will focus on the normal approximation to the binomial as an
illustrative example. Historically, these approximations were critical
for computing probabilities by hand in a timely fashion. Owing to the
widespread use of statistical software, these use cases are more and
more limited. However, there are two major advantages to learning these
approximations. First, with an approximation it becomes easier to
leverage the intuition you will build regarding the normal distribution
in order to better understand the behaviour of other random quantities.
Second, the normal approximation has the same \emph{flavour} as many
results in statistics, and so it presents an additional path to
familiarity with these types of findings.

Suppose that \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)\). Through knowledge of the binomial
distribution, we know that \(E[X] = np\) and
\(\text{var}(X) = np(1-p)\). If \(n\) is sufficiently large then it is
possible to approximate a binomial distribution using a normal
distribution with the corresponding mean and variance. That is, for
\(n\) large enough, we can take \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)\) to have
approximately the same distribution as \[W\sim N(np, np(1-p)).\]

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-normal-approximation}A plot showing the probability
mass function of a \(\text{Bin}(100, 0.25)\) distribution, with a
\(N(25, 18.75)\) density overlaid, demonstrating the utility of the
approximation.}

\centering{

\includegraphics{notes/chapter9_files/figure-pdf/fig-normal-approximation-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

One consideration that we need to make when applying this approximation
has to do with the fact that the normal distribution is continuous while
the binomial distribution is discrete. As a result, the normal
distribution can take on any value on the real line, where the binomial
is limited to the integers. A question that we must answer is what to do
with the non-integer valued numbers. The natural solution is to rely on
rounding. That is, for any value between \([1.5, 2.5)\) we would round
to the nearest integer, which is \(2\).

\begin{definition}[Continuity
Correction]\protect\hypertarget{def-continuity-correction}{}\label{def-continuity-correction}

The continuity correction is a technique for adjusting the probabilities
computed using a continuous approximation to a discrete random variable.
The correction relies on rounding non-integer values, which may be
observed with regards to the continuous random variable, to the
corresponding integer values for the discrete random variable that is
being approximated.

\end{definition}

This natural solution is in fact a fairly useful technique, and it is
the one that we will make use of in the normal approximation. While
rounding is quite natural, the process for leveraging this idea in
probability approximation is somewhat backwards. That is, we typically
will need to go from probabilities relating to \(X\) and transform those
into probabilities relating to \(W\). So, for instance, if we wish to
know \(P(X \leq 2)\), then we need to be able to make this a statement
regarding the random variable \(W\). In order to do this we need to ask
``what is the largest value for \(W\) that would get rounded to \(2\)?''
The answer is \(2.5\) and so \(P(X \leq 2) \approx P(W \leq 2.5)\).

A similar adjustment would be required if we instead wanted
\(P(X \geq 5)\). Here we would ask ``what is the smallest value for
\(W\) which would get rounded to \(5\)?'' and note that the answer is
\(4.5\). Thus, \(P(X \geq 5) \approx P(W \geq 4.5)\). Once we have
expressed the probability of interest in terms of the normal random
variable, we can use the standard techniques previously outlined to
compute the relevant probabilities. It is very important to note that
these two results are of the form \(X \geq x\) and \(X \leq x'\). If we
instead had considered \(X > x\) or \(X < x'\), we would need to take an
additional step.

For continuous random variables whether \(X \geq x\) or \(X > x\) is
considered makes no difference. However, for discrete random variables
this is not the case. As a result we should first convert the event the
an equivalent event which contains the equality sign within the
inequality, and then apply the continuity correction. That is, if we
want \(P(X > 3)\) first note that for \(X > 3\) to hold, we could
equivalently write this as \(X \geq 4\). Alternatively, if the event of
interest is \(X < 8\), this is the same as \(X \leq 7\).

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Payouts over a
Year]\protect\hypertarget{exm-normal-approximation}{}\label{exm-normal-approximation}

Charles and Sadie are back sitting at the coffee shop, reflecting on all
of the probability that they have learned since their games began. They
realize that each time they play the game to see who will pay, that is a
Bernoulli trial with \(0.5\) probability. As a result, over the course
of the year, if they go \(200\) times to get coffee, the number of times
each of them will have to pay is governed by a \(\text{Bin}(200, 0.5)\)
random variable. Charles realizes that this is infeasible to work with a
binomial distribution, and so seeks another way.\footnote{Note that, for
  instance,
  \(\binom{200}{75} = 168849997346404286704489530268603459022868706883102845056\).
  This is \(168\) septendecillion. This is \(3.2\) million times more
  than the number of possible arrangements of a chess board. This is a
  silly large number.} Sadie suggest that they could use the normal
approximation to the binomial.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the approximate probability that Charles pays more than
  \(115\) times in a year, expressed in terms of \(\Phi\).
\item
  What is the approximate probability that Sadie will pay between \(86\)
  and \(107\) times? Explain how this can be approximated numerically.
\item
  Give an upper and lower bound that both Charles and Sadie can be
  \(95\%\) sure they will pay between (that is, two numbers such that
  the probability they pay at least the lower and at most the upper
  bound is \(0.95\)).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

For these questions we will take \(X \sim \text{Bin}(200, 0.5)\), and
therefore, \(X \dot\sim W \sim N(100, 50)\). Thus, to calculate these
probabilities, we can use normal approximations, making sure to apply
the continuity corrections.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We want \(P(X > 115)\). This is the same as asking \(P(X \geq 116)\),
  and with the continuity correction,
  \(P(X \geq 116) \approx P(W \geq 115.5)\). Thus, we take
  \[P(W \geq 115.5) = P\left(Z \geq \frac{115.5 - 100}{\sqrt{50}}\right) = 1 - \Phi\left(2.192\right).\]
  This could be worked out using a normal probability
  calculator.\footnotemark{}
\item
  We want
  \[P(86 < X < 107) = P(87 \leq X \leq 106 \approx P(87.5 \leq W \leq 106.5).\]
  Note that if we consider
  \[\frac{106.5 - 100}{\sqrt{50}} = 0.919 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{87.5 - 100}{\sqrt{50}} = -1.838.\]
  If we wanted to get a rough approximation of this, we could say that,
  from the empirical rule, the probability that
  \begin{multline*}P(\mu_W - 1.838\sigma_W \leq W \leq \mu_W + 0.919\sigma_W) \leq P(\mu_W - 2\sigma_W \leq W \leq \mu_W + \sigma_W) \\
  = \frac{0.68}{2} + \frac{0.95}{2} = 0.815.\end{multline*} Note that
  this gives an upper bound on the probability. We could also get a
  lower bound on the probability by moving in the other directions,
  \[P(\mu_W - 1.838\sigma_W \leq W \leq \mu_W + 0.919\sigma_W) \leq P(\mu_W - 2\sigma_W \leq W \leq \mu_W) = \frac{0.95}{2} = 0.475.\]
  This gives a fairly wide range, but we can be relatively confident it
  will be a lot closer to \(0.815\) than to \(0.475\), since the values
  are a lot close to \(-2\) and \(1\) than \(-1\) and
  \(0\).\footnotemark{}
\item
  Note that, if we use a normal approximation and the empirical rule, we
  know that there is approximately a \(0.95\) probability that a random
  variable falls within \(2\sigma\) of the mean. The mean of \(W\) is
  \(100\) and \(\sigma = \sqrt{50}\), so we can take the interval
  \([85.8578, 114.1421]\). Note that if we widen this slightly the
  probability will increase slightly, so that the probability
  \(W \in [85.5, 114.5]\) must be greater than \(0.95\). The quantity
  \(P(85.5 \leq W \leq 114.5)\) corresponds to
  \(P(86 \leq X \leq 114)\), and so we can say that Charles and Sadie
  can each be roughly \(95\%\) confident that they will need to pay
  between \(86\) and \(114\) times.\footnotemark{}
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\footnotetext{Doing so results in 0.0141898. Note, if we had used a
binomial probability calculator instead, we would have gotten
0.0140627.}

\footnotetext{In fact, the actual probability here is 0.7824647.}

\footnotetext{The actual binomial probabilities here are 0.9519985,
while the normal approximation is 0.959695.}

\end{example}

When it is not necessary, it rarely makes sense to use an approximation.
There will be cases where the approximation is directly useful, and in
those moments it is great to be able to use it. This example of using
the normal distribution to approximate a discrete random variable serves
as a nice bridge from the study of probability to the study of
statistics. In statistics we take a different view of the types of
problems we have been considering to date, and we require the tools of
probability that have been brought forth. As a result, a deep comfort
with manipulating probability expressions is required to build a strong
foundation while studying statistics.

\section{From Probability to
Statistics}\label{from-probability-to-statistics}

Until this point we have focused on the study of probability. At its
core, probability is a subject which seeks to quantify the uncertainty
present in statistical experiments. In the study of probability we begin
by first making assumptions about the state of the world\footnote{For
  instance, we assume that particular probability mass functions hold,
  that certain distributions are present, that random quantities are
  independent} and from there we draw conclusions about what must be
true about the state of uncertainty in the world. In this regard,
probability answers questions of the form ``if this is true about the
world, what should we see?'' For instance, if a fair coin is tossed
\(100\) times, what is the likelihood that more than half of the tosses
come up heads? We have made the assumption that we have a fair coin,
tossed independently, and we wish to quantify our degree of uncertainty
about this scenario.

This is not the only way that we could frame problems related to
uncertainty. For instance, what if we asked ``given the results from
\(100\) tosses of this coin, do we believe that the coin is fair?'' This
inversion of the previous question starts from the observation of
information from an experiment and asks questions about the underlying
mechanisms that generated these data.\footnote{Note, the word
  \emph{data} is a plural noun in english. That is, we say ``The
  observed data are \ldots{}'' rather than ``The observed data is
  \ldots{}'' Some statisticians care deeply about correcting this
  misconception, and forget how weird those types of sentences to
  non-statisticians. I promise it will eventually sound more familiar!}
This type of question is addressed by the field of \textbf{statistics}.

\begin{definition}[Statistics (Field of
Study)]\protect\hypertarget{def-statistics}{}\label{def-statistics}

Statistics is the discipline in which data are collected, analyzed, and
presented with the goal of understanding the mechanisms through which
those data were generated.

\end{definition}

In Probability we make assumptions about the world and calculate
probabilities. These probabilities describe what we should expect to see
if we were to observe the processes as they were assumed to exist. In
Statistics, we collect information from statistical experiments, and use
these data to infer what conditions were likely to have given rise to
our observations. We are back solving for what set of assumptions are
most plausible, given the observations. Uncertainty remains at the core
of statistics. We will rarely be able to know \emph{for certain} what
different assumptions gave rise to the data that we observe, but instead
look to clarify and quantify the ever-present uncertainty. Probability
remains central to the study of statistics. Specifically, probability is
the core tool for quantifying the ever-present uncertainty. Probability
statements are the language of Statistics. As a result, the study of
Statistics is largely the study of how we can take the set of tools that
have been developed throughout the first part of this course, and apply
them in the reverse direction. Statistics gives us the tools that we
need to make sense of the world around us. Statistics serves as a
process for evaluating the quality of evidence and drawing conclusions
from it. Statistics is the necessary area of study to draw informed
conclusions from the information that we collect. Ultimately, it is
Statistics which powers quantitative decision-making. Virtually every
avenue of the modern world demands that we make decisions on the basis
of incomplete or imperfect information, and through Statistics we can
ensure that these decisions are as informed as possible.

\section{Background and Data}\label{background-and-data}

It is important to formalize some of the terminology upon which we will
rely. A key challenge in formalizing these ideas is that, for many of
these central concepts, we have an intuitive or colloquial sense of the
idea. Just as with Probability, a large part of our goal during the
early phases of learning Statistics revolves around connecting
formalized ideas to intuitive concepts that we are familiar with from
other contexts.

\begin{definition}[Data]\protect\hypertarget{def-data}{}\label{def-data}

Facts, figures, observations, or recordings in virtually any form
(images, sounds, text, measurements) which are gathered and processed to
form and communicate conclusions.

\end{definition}

Data sit at the center of Statistics as the prime objects of study. We
are concerned with how we can take data and draw valid conclusions. This
may be by ensuring that the data are collected in a way which is
suitable to draw conclusions, or by finding ways to graphically display
the information within collected data, or by drawing inferences about
the world using the data on hand. Data are the prime focus of
Statistics. The data themselves are not particularly descriptive or
actionable. Instead, the data are transformed into useful information
through statistical techniques. We will broadly refer to any such
process as a statistical analysis.

The goal of a statistical analysis can be placed into one of four
categories. These categories define the four purposes of statistics.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Descriptive statistics}: Descriptive statistics focuses on
  organizing and summarizing information. With descriptive statistics we
  seek to \textbf{describe} the current state of the world which lead to
  the data we have collected.
\item
  \textbf{Inferential statistics}: Inferential statistics provides
  methods for drawing conclusions and quantifying the uncertainty
  surrounding these conclusions, with regards to a population or process
  response for the data collected. With inferential statistics we seek
  to \textbf{infer} the underlying truth about a population or process
  of interest.
\item
  \textbf{Predictive statistics}: Predictive statistics provides methods
  for making predictions regarding the future behaviour of a process or
  population based on past observations from that population or process.
  With predictive statistics we seek to \textbf{predict} what is to come
  in the future.
\item
  \textbf{Prescriptive statistics}: Prescriptive statistics provides
  methods for suggesting interventions into a population or process
  according to its likely impact on a chosen criteria. With prescriptive
  statistics we seek to \textbf{prescribe} interventions based on what
  is likely to happen.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Categorized
Questions]\protect\hypertarget{exm-type-of-statistics}{}\label{exm-type-of-statistics}

Back out for coffee after a relaxing break, Charles and Sadie turn their
attention to thinking about the possible use cases for Statistics. They
begin to play a game, trying to identify which of the four major
categories would be most appropriate to address their various questions
of interest. For each of the following, identify whether the problem is
best approached through descriptive, inferential, predictive, or
prescriptive statistical techniques.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles wonders how many people, on average, visit the coffee shop
  each day.
\item
  Sadie wonders if the type of music playing in the shop impacts what
  purchases customers make.
\item
  Charles wants to determine how many chocolate chip cookies the coffee
  shop should prepare for Saturday morning.
\item
  Sadie wonders what the most common drink add-in is.
\item
  Charles wants to know how much the coffee shop should sell their
  coffees for, if they are trying to maximize income.
\item
  Sadie wants to understand how many people have signed up for the
  loyalty program.
\item
  Charles wonders if there is a meaningful difference between people's
  orders who sign up for the loyalty program and those who don't.
\item
  Sadie, in turn, questions how much the loyalty program is likely to
  grow over the next month.
\item
  Charles wants to understand how the reward tiers can be changed to
  grow the royalty program faster.
\end{enumerate}

  This is \textbf{prescriptive}. This is an attempt to suggest an

\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Each of the various roles that statistics can play is defined in terms
of \textbf{populations}\footnote{or \emph{processes}}. We understand
this at an intuitive level, and this intuition is strong place to begin
to formalize Statistics.

\begin{definition}[Population]\protect\hypertarget{def-population}{}\label{def-population}

The collection of all individuals or items that are under consideration
in a study or experiment.

\end{definition}

In many settings, the population is a well-defined, concrete idea. We
may think of all individuals who attend a particular university, all
birds of a species living in a particular park, all cards of a
particular model made last year at a given factory. In each of these
cases we can envision taking all members of the population\footnote{Be
  that individuals or objects.} and placing them in one location. If we
were able to do this, any questions we had about the population could be
directly answered. This is not typically possible in these cases owing
to practical considerations regarding the resources that would be
required.\footnote{It is not impossible to do so. For instance,
  governments often run national censuses, which are a full survey of
  every member of the population of a country. These are incredibly
  large undertakings, however, and are not feasible in many settings.}
In many other settings, we cannot even imagine grouping the entire
population of interest together, since the population is less concretely
defined.

Consider, for instance, investigating the quality of vaccines that are
produced at a particular facility. This facility will continue producing
vaccines indefinitely into the future, and we may wish to know about the
set of these future items. Similarly, we may wish to understand the
impact of a particular teaching style on children's ability to learn
math skills. In this case, we are not concerned with one particular
school or one particular school board or one particular set of students.
Rather we want to know how do children \textbf{in general} respond to
this teaching intervention. In cases like these the population of
interest is less concrete and more \textbf{conceptual}. It is not a
specific well-defined group of individuals or items, and it may be
possibly infinite. Instead of being able to collect all of the items of
the population together we are only able to assess any individual or
item and answer ``is this a member of the described population?''. We
refer to these as \textbf{conceptual populations}.

\begin{definition}[Conceptual
Population]\protect\hypertarget{def-conceptual-pop}{}\label{def-conceptual-pop}

A set of individuals, items, or observations which are hypothetical in
the sense that they do not tangibly exist as a concrete group, but
instead share a common feature which defines the population. The units
in the conceptual population are linked through the circumstances that
they arise under resulting from conditions which are equivalent in some
way. Sometimes conceptual populations are called \textbf{hypothetical
populations}.

\end{definition}

The utility of a conceptual population is that it allows us to unify the
framework of Statistics whether we are studying groups of people or
objects that really do exist in front of us, or those which we can
describe but not collect. Even something as well-defined as the
population of a country, for instance, is a population which may be
conceptual in many regards. There are constantly new individuals being
born in the country, those who are dying, those moving to or away from
it. Still, none of us are confused about what we mean by the
``population of a country''. Likewise, conceptual populations in
statistics are well-defined, even if they remain intangible.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Identify
Populations]\protect\hypertarget{exm-populations}{}\label{exm-populations}

Charles and Sadie had such fun identifying the uses for statistics
during their last conversation, today at coffee they decide to identify
populations of interest. They open up the local paper to the science
section, and begin to read the headlines. For each headline, indicate
the population of interest and specify whether or not this is a
conceptual population.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Study Finds Link Between Coffee Consumption and Productivity in
  Office Workers''
\item
  ``Research Shows Decline in Pollinator Populations Across Agricultural
  Regions''
\item
  ``Poll Indicates Attitudes Toward Healthcare Reform Among Registered
  Voters''
\item
  ``Research Reveals Impact of Air Pollution on Respiratory Health Among
  Children in New York City in 2023''
\item
  ``Survey Explores Relationship Between Social Support and Mental
  Health Among LGBTQ+ Youth''
\item
  ``Poll Indicates Satisfaction with Public Transportation Among
  Commuters in Metropolitan Areas in Canada''
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The population of interest here is simply ``office workers''. This is
  a conceptual population as we can easily tell whether or not someone
  belongs to the population (ask whether they work in an office), but we
  cannot easily describe the complete group of individuals.
\item
  The population of interest here is pollinators in agricultural
  regions. This is a conceptual population as it will be constantly
  shifting and changing. We are able to describe whether a particular
  animal is a pollinator living in an agricultural region, but we are
  not able to enumerate through the animals which would satisfy this.
\item
  The population of interest here is registered voters (wherever the
  study is run). This is not a conceptual population as a voter registry
  contains a list of all of the people within this population. It may be
  the case that this will change over time, but we can concretely
  determine the population at this point in time.
\item
  The population is children in New York City in 2023. This is not a
  conceptual population as, while there is not any practical way of
  gathering all children living in New York City in 2023 together in one
  place, this is a fully describable population that (given enough
  resources) could be gathered together.
\item
  The population of interest here is LGBTQ+ youth. This is a conceptual
  population, as we are able to assess membership to the population, but
  not fully enumerate the members.
\item
  The population here is Canadian metropolitan-area commuters. This is a
  conceptual population.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

Ultimately, our goal with statistics is to understand a population.
However, as a general rule, we are unable to directly observe the
entirety of the population. While it is typically infeasible to observe
the entire population, we are often able to observe some units from the
population. These units, when collected together, are referred to as a
\textbf{sample}.

\begin{definition}[Sample]\protect\hypertarget{def-sample}{}\label{def-sample}

A sample is a subset of a population which is observed, and as a result,
information regarding these units is obtainable.

\end{definition}

Thus, taken together we are interested in a particular population. We
are typically unable to observe our population in full, and instead
content ourselves with the capacity to view a subset of this population,
which is referred to as a sample. Generally speaking, we are interested
in some numeric quantities which describe the population. Perhaps we
wish to know the average height of students in a school, or the total
number of calls that are made at a company over a period of time, or the
maximum litter size for a breed of house cats, or the proportion of
defective units produced during a manufacturing run. In each of these
situations, the question of interest relates to a quantity describing
the population. If we were able to view the entirety of the population,
we could simply compute the value of quantity. We refer to such
quantities as \textbf{parameters}.

\begin{definition}[Parameter]\protect\hypertarget{def-parameter}{}\label{def-parameter}

A parameter is a numeric quantity of interest which is defined with
regards to a population. A parameter captures the behaviour of the
population. Typically the value of parameters will be unknown and
unknowable.

\end{definition}

The fact that parameters are generally unknowable is the central tension
at the heart of many statistical problems. To resolve this tension we
turn our focus towards quantities which can be computed, namely those
which are derived from samples that we have taken. These quantities are
aptly named \textbf{statistics}.

\begin{definition}[Statistics
(Quantities)]\protect\hypertarget{def-statistics-quantity}{}\label{def-statistics-quantity}

A statistic is a numeric quantity of interest that is computed on a
sample. Any quantity which is calculated based on observed data from a
sample is a statistic.

\end{definition}

In this regard, Statistics as a subject is the study of statistics (as
quantities). For instance, if we take the average height of a group of
students, or the number of calls made by a selection of employees during
a period of time, or the maximum size that a particular cat breeder has
for a litter, or the proportion of defective products from a random
selection of items sampled from a manufacturing run, each of these are
statistics. Note that to differentiate a statistic from a parameter we
are functionally differentiating between whether the quantity was
computed on a sample or a population. There is no difference in the
quantity itself, it is what the quantity is computed with respect to.

Thus, with these definitions we are able to concretely outline the
process of statistics. We have interest in a particular population,
conceptual or otherwise. Specifically, we have questions which are
answered by parameters defined for this population. These parameters are
unknowable since it is infeasible to observe all members of the
population, and so instead we turn to taking observations for subsets of
the population. These subsets are called samples, and samples are
observable. Once observed, we are able to compute quantities of interest
on the samples, referred to as statistics. It is our hope that somehow
these statistics will be representative of the underlying parameters of
interest, thus allowing us to answer the questions about the populations
using information from the sample.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-population-sample}On overview of the process of
statistics. Visualized is the complete population, which is unable to be
observed in full. There exist a parameter (or parameters) of interest
that are computable from this population. We take a sample (subset) of
this population, and can more accurately observe this sample, allowing
us to compute the value of a statistic. This statistic is meant to
correspond to the parameter of interest.}

\begin{example}[Experiments in the Coffee
Shop]\protect\hypertarget{exm-process-of-statistics}{}\label{exm-process-of-statistics}

Charles and Sadie, fully bought into the process of statistics, decide
to put their new knowledge to the test. To do so they wish to determine
how the process of statistics would apply to the world around them, in
the coffee shop. For each of the following scenarios indicate what the
population of interest would be, whether it is conceptual or concrete,
identify the parameter of interest, a possible sample of size \(4\), and
the relevant statistic.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  To understand the daily traffic in the coffee shop, Charles counts the
  number of individuals who pass into the store in a particular hour.
\item
  To better understand the profitability of the store, Sadie collects
  the receipt totals for each of the customers arriving at the coffee
  shop.
\item
  To understand how the coffee shop has integrated into the community,
  both Charles and Sadie monitor the proportion of customers who are
  students at the local school, each day.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The population of interest is the customers of the coffee shop. This
  is a conceptual population. The parameter of interest is the average
  number of customers per day arriving at the coffee shop. Notably,
  Charles is measuring the average number per hour rather than per day,
  but this could be accommodated for during the analysis. Samples of
  size \(4\) would observe watching four separate hours, and counting
  the number of customers in the store each hour: one possibility would
  be \(\{5, 35, 3, 22\}\). The statistic calculated is likely the
  average per hour (or a scaled version to convert it to the day). Based
  on the sample that is \(16.25\).
\item
  The population of interest is the purchases made at the coffee shop.
  This is a conceptual population. The parameter of interest is the
  average size of a purchase. Samples of size \(4\) would include any
  four observation of totals that could be observed at the store,
  perhaps \(\{\$1.20, \$23.18, \$14.21, \$5.87\}\). The statistic of
  interest would be the average size of the transaction. Based on the
  sample that is \(\$11.115\).
\item
  Here, the population of interest is the customers of the coffee shop.
  This is a conceptual population. The parameter of interest is the
  proportion of customers who are students at the local school. A sample
  of size \(4\) would be any four proportions observed from the day,
  perhaps \(\{0.2, 0.1, 0.08, 0.25\}\). The statistic of interest is the
  average proportion, based on the sample that is \(0.1825\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

With this process outlined, we can revisit the roles that statistics
will serve. Ultimately, our goal is to effectively use collected
data\footnote{The sample.} to discern and communicate information. We
look to do this by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{describing} the collected data, conveying the information that
  we have gathered;
\item
  \textbf{inferring} conclusions about our population parameters from
  our sample statistics;
\item
  \textbf{predicting} out-of-sample observations, based on the sampled
  ones; or
\item
  \textbf{prescribing} interventions for the population to influence a
  parameter.
\end{enumerate}

The value in each of these applications stems from the capacity that we
have to connect the sample to the population. As a result, much of our
statistical focus centers on finding ways to ensure that our conclusions
drawn from our sample are reflective of the overall population.

To understand how this is possible, consider an experiment which seeks
to determine whether a particular coin is fair. Suppose that we toss it
\(100\) times, and see \(54\) heads. Is this a fair coin? While we
cannot be entirely sure, this seems to be more-or-less in line with the
number of heads that we would expect to see if the coin were fair. There
is uncertainty present, but we can be more certain that this is a fair
coin compared to our beliefs prior to running the experiment. Now
imagine that instead of seeing \(54\) heads on \(100\) tosses, we had
seen \(94\). Immediately we should be skeptical that this coin is fair.
It is perfectly possible that we see \(94\) heads on \(100\) tosses of a
fair coin\footnote{The probability of this is
  \(0.00000000000000000000094036353533487965306938402439390200376889694666715513449162\),
  which is very, very small, but not zero.}, but it is not likely. It
does not seem to be what we would expect to observe, and as a result, we
are right to be skeptical of this.

This intuitive connection between what we can say about the population
and the sample relies upon the sample being representative of the
population. We would not take flips from another coin to be evidence of
whether our coin is biased. We would not consider the sample to be
particularly representative if instead of writing down every result, we
ignored every time that more than one tail came up in a row. The
intuitions we have about the relationship between our sample and our
population rely on the assumption that the sample represents the
population in some meaningful sense. Choosing a representative sample
is, as a result, an important aspect of the statistical process.

\section{Sampling}\label{sampling}

Sampling is an area of study within statistics which focuses on the
process through which units are recruited from the population into our
sample. If the units we observe are biased in some way, or are
inappropriately recruited, then it is immediately clear that conclusions
drawn about the sample will not be transportable to the population.
Imagine, for instance, that we are interested in the height of students
at a university. If our sample contains only members of the basketball
and volleyball teams, this will not be reflective of the heights of most
students at the school. Our sample is unrepresentative. With sampling
our goal is to select the sample in such a way so as to make guarantees
about the information we learn from it, quantifying our uncertainty, and
being relatively confident in our conclusions.

When we deal with populations which are conceptual in nature it may make
less sense to think of sampling directly. For instance, it seems strange
to think of our previous example of repeatedly rolling a die in the same
manner that we think of recruiting students and measuring their heights.
In the case where we wish to learn about a process rather than a
concrete population, we will often frame the generation of our sample
not through the language of \emph{sampling} but rather through the
language of \textbf{experimental design}. The design of experiments
refers to the same set of factors that are considered for sampling: how
can we ensure that the units we observe will be representative of the
underlying population or process. However, with experimental design it
is largely the case that we are in direct control of the types of
factors that may lead our process to being unrepresentative. It is up to
us to ensure that the units that are being generated, through the
conceptual population, are representative of the units we are interested
in based on the research question.

Our focus in this class will be on investigating several of the
techniques used in sampling and experimental design to ensure that the
samples we use are related to the population of interest in predictable
ways. It will always be possible that, even following best practices and
being very careful with our implementation, we end up choosing a sample
or having experimental units which are nonrepresentative. This is
uncertainty which is unavoidable in any scientific inquiry. Our goal
then is to understand this uncertainty, to quantify it, and to ensure
that we are able to understand precisely how big of a risk is this lack
of representation, and how will that change the results we can report.
We begin by describing techniques which can be used to ensure that
samples are good representations for the populations of interest. In the
next section, we will turn to the same types of considerations for
experimental design.

\subsection{Simple Random Sampling}\label{simple-random-sampling}

When considering the process of data collection via sampling, the
primary decision to make is on the \textbf{sampling design}. The
sampling design refers to the strategy that is employed to decide which
members of the population will comprise the sample. Some sampling
designs will not result in valid or representative samples. The most
straightforward sampling design, which, if applied correctly, will
produce valid samples is simple random sampling.

\begin{definition}[Simple Random
Sampling]\protect\hypertarget{def-simple-random-sampling}{}\label{def-simple-random-sampling}

Simple random sampling is a sampling procedure in which each possible
sample of a given size is equally likely to be obtained.

\end{definition}

Simple random sampling produces a \textbf{simple random sample}. Simple
random sampling is far and away the most important sampling scheme. It
is an effective way of drawing a representative sample itself, it is
intuitive, and it forms the basis of many other, more complex sampling
schemes. Generally, we can think of simple random sampling as
\textbf{sampling without replacement}.\footnote{This, as we will
  remember from our previous chapters, makes the hypergeometric
  distribution deeply connected to simple random sampling.} Suppose we
take our population to correspond to items in an urn, each labelled with
the corresponding unit. Then a simple random sample is typically formed
by selecting \(n\) items from the urn without replacement. Those which
are selected form the sample. If desired, for any reason at all, it is
possible to form a simple random sample \textbf{with replacement}, where
in this setting the balls would be placed back into the urn after each
selection. Whether the sample is to be formed with or without
replacement, the same general procedure will be followed. Each member of
the population will get assigned a numeric label (from \(1\) through to
\(N\), the population size) and then software is used to select a subset
of \(n\) of the labels.

\begin{example}[Rating Coffee
Orders]\protect\hypertarget{exm-sadie-samples-drinks}{}\label{exm-sadie-samples-drinks}

Charles and Sadie are still attending the coffee shop, and Charles is
still working through the \(960\) different orders that are available
(recall Example~\ref{exm-counting-coffee-orders}). Sadie, with a
stronger grasp on statistics now, decides to try to understand the
general quality of orders at the coffee shop. To do so, instead of
ordering every possible meal (as Charles is doing), Sadie considers a
simple random sample of possible orders.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose that Sadie wants to understand the quality based on the next
  twenty visits to the coffee shop. Describe the procedure for forming a
  simple random sample.
\item
  What is the probability that Sadie's current order will be one of the
  orders included in the simple random sample?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sadie desires a simple random sample of size \(n=20\) from the
  \(N=960\) different orders. To do so, suppose that we order each of
  the orders from \(1,2,\dots,960\) (perhaps ordered based on the order
  in which Charles will try them). Then Sadie will randomly selected,
  without replacement, \(20\) numbers from these values. These orders
  will then be taken over the next twenty visits, with Sadie recording
  whatever information is relevant for each of them. For instance, Sadie
  may end up select the orders corresponding to:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
##  [1] 834 499 529 376 910 931 549 620 623 169 419 754 296  80 276 342 918 855 265
## [20]  87
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Sadie's current order is \(1\) of the possible options of the \(960\).
  While we can work this out from first principles, we can also take
  this to be a hypergeometric random variable with \(n=20\), \(N=960\),
  and \(M=1\). Then we want \(P(X = 1)\). For this, using the
  probability mass function of a hypergeometric random variable, we get
  \[P(X = 1) = \frac{\binom{1}{1}\binom{959}{19}}{\binom{960}{20}} = \frac{1}{48}.\]
  Note this is \(\dfrac{20}{960} = \dfrac{n}{N}\). In general, this will
  be true for \textbf{any} simple random sample.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

There is an appeal in the simplicity of simple random sampling.
Moreover, it is quite clear how, as long as enough units are sampled,
simple random sampling will result in a sample which is representative
of the overall population. Despite these benefits, there are some
drawbacks that are not easily overcome in the simple random sampling
paradigm. For instance, if you imagine a situation in which your sample
is spread over a large geographic region, it is unlikely to be practical
to form a simple random sample. Additionally, if you do not have a list
of all population members, a simple random sample cannot be formed as
described.\footnote{There are ways of doing this, but they are more
  complex and fall beyond the scope of this course.} Another practical
concern involves sampling in this regard when units have a natural
ordering. Suppose that you are looking to test the impact of a new
cancer therapy, and wish to form a sample of current cancer patients who
will receive the experimental treatment to see if it improves over the
current practice. If you form through simple random sampling it is
possible that you will have only patients who are newly diagnosed or
else only patients who have had their diagnosis for a long time. Neither
situation is a particularly effective method for testing the therapy,
and it becomes a large practice issue where you likely want to ensure
that you have both sets of individuals represented in the sample.

To overcome these issues with simple random sampling, alternative
sampling designs have been proposed. These alternatives can lead to more
convenience in the sampling, and perhaps yield more accurate results
than a simple random sample can. It is important to note that these
alternative designs are only more effective when the design itself is
taken into account when analyzing or describing the data.

\subsection{Systematic Random
Sampling}\label{systematic-random-sampling}

One alternative design to simple random sampling, which is closely
related, is known as systematic random sampling.

\begin{definition}[Systematic Random
Sampling]\protect\hypertarget{def-systematic-rs}{}\label{def-systematic-rs}

In systematic random sampling the sample is selected by choosing a
random starting point from the list of members of the population, and
then sampling every \(k\)th member until the desired sample size is
reached.

\end{definition}

Systematic sampling forms a sample that looks like a simple random
sample, but it is more straightforward to implement. If you want a
sample of size \(50\) from a population of size \(500\), then by
selecting every \(10\)th member of the population, you will achieve the
sample you desire. You want to be able to pick any individual from the
population, and so you should randomly select the starting point before
picking every \(10\)th member. Selecting every \(10th\) individual is
more straightforward administratively than generating random numbers and
sampling those indices, particularly when there is a natural ordering of
the individuals. However, there are some implementation decisions which
need to be made, notably: what should \(k\) be and who should be the
first individual included? It is common to have the process of
systematic random sampling described as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Divide the population size, \(N\), by the desired sample size, \(n\),
  and round the result down to the nearest whole number. This will be
  \(k\).
\item
  Select a number, \(m\), randomly between \(1\) and \(k\). This will be
  the starting point.
\item
  Include in the sample \(m\), \(m+k\), \(m+2k\), and so forth until the
  last unit of the sample.
\end{enumerate}

This will generally form a usable sample, if its shortcomings are
properly accounted for. However, it is not without its shortcomings as a
procedure.

To understand why this can lead to issues suppose that we have \(N=7\),
and want to form a sample of size \(n=3\). Using this procedure we get
\(k=2\), as the result of rounding down \(\dfrac{7}{3}=2.33\dot3\).
Next, we select either \(1\) or \(2\) as our starting point. If we
select \(1\) then we end up including \(\{1,3,5\}\) and if we select
\(2\) then we get \(\{2,4,6\}\). Note that in we will never select item
number \(7\), which means that there is no chance it is represented in
our sample. This is a problem. There are plenty of ways to resolve this
concern, some of which lead to other issues themselves.

One small modification that can made is to select \(m\) between \(1\)
and \(N-(n-1)k\).\footnote{Instead of selecting \(m\) between \(1\) and
  \(k\).} This will ensure that it is always possible to select up to
the last unit. In our example with \(N=7\) and \(n=3\), the starting
point is selected from \(1,2,3\) giving in addition to the two
possibilities outlined above, \(\{3,5,7\}\) as a third option. This
alleviates the issues of not including some members of the population in
any possible sample. When this technique is used, however, it is worth
noting that some elements become more likely to be included than the
others.\footnote{For instance, \(3\) and \(5\) both show up twice, while
  every other element shows up only once.} This can be accounted for
during analysis, but it needs to be completely understood to do so.

\begin{example}[Randomly Sampling Customer
Experience]\protect\hypertarget{exm-systematic-sampling}{}\label{exm-systematic-sampling}

Sadie, content with the results of the simple random sampling of
possible meals, decides to try to understand the overall customer
satisfaction of individuals coming into the coffee shop. Charles
suggests that a systematic sample may be in order, and they set out
planning this.

Suppose that Charles and Sadie expect there to be \(98\) customers
arriving in a day, and they wish to sample \(10\) of them.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe the process of forming a systematic sample from this
  population, including the specific values for the choices that are
  made.
\item
  What is a risk of this sampling design?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Here we have \(N=98\) and want \(n=10\), thus we take
  \(k = \lfloor\dfrac{98}{10}\rfloor = 9\). We want to select the
  starting value between \(1\) and
  \(98 - 9\times(10-1) = 98 - 81 = 17\). Thus there are a total of
  \(17\) different samples we could wind up with. These are summarized
  as follows:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  This sampling design has several risks. The first is that there is no
  guarantee that \(N=98\) is the correct population size. As a result,
  this could end up not producing \(n=10\) or having \(n=10\) before the
  end of the day. A second possible issue is if there are temporal
  patterns to customers arriving, such that groups of customers are
  missed with high probability. Cyclical patterns do not lend themselves
  well to systematic sampling, and it is plausible that customer
  arrivals to a coffee shop may exhibit some cyclical tendencies.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\subsection{Cluster Sampling}\label{cluster-sampling}

While systematic sampling can be a more straightforward method for
implementing a sample that looks like a simple random sample, it is
generally not going to alleviate concerns with (for instance) geographic
separation. In this case the issue with either of the two aforementioned
sampling schemes is that it they each would take substantial resources
to send researchers to the area where the units to be sampled are. A
remedy to this is to turn to \textbf{cluster sampling}.

\begin{definition}[Cluster
Sampling]\protect\hypertarget{def-cluster-sampling}{}\label{def-cluster-sampling}

In cluster sampling individuals are grouped together into
\emph{clusters}. The clusters are then sampled at random, according to a
simple random sampling scheme. Any selected cluster is then sampled in
full.

\end{definition}

For instance, you may define clusters based on the geographic region
that is occupied. This way you can ensure, for instance, that you only
visit a set number of geographic regions, while still sampling enough
individuals to collect useful data. A key criteria for cluster sampling
to be valid is that each cluster should represent the overall population
well. This can be an issue where members of a cluster are often more
similar to one another than to members of other clusters. As a result,
you can end up with an unrepresentative sample owing to the clustered
nature of the sampling. In order to form a cluster sample, the procedure
is essentially equivalent to simple random sampling. First, the
population is divided into groups (clusters) which are labelled from
\(1\) through to the number of clusters that there are. Then, the
clusters are randomly sampled, according to a simple random sample.
Finally, all members of the selected clusters are included into the
overall sample.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Sample their
City]\protect\hypertarget{exm-clustered-sample}{}\label{exm-clustered-sample}

Charles and Sadie are reflecting upon the chocolate bars that they sold
for charity in the past. They want to understand the feelings that
members of their city have towards charitable giving. They feel that
sampling \(300\) homes is a useful number, but given that they will be
going door-to-door, they want to do this in a clustered pattern. The
city is made up of \(947\) blocks, each with \(20\) homes on it.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe how Charles and Sadie could use clustered sampling to form
  the sample that they desire.
\item
  What issues may arise using clustered sampling in this way?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Here we have \(N=18940\) and we want a sample of \(n=300\). In order
  to achieve \(n=300\), we require selecting \(15\) clusters, since each
  cluster has \(20\) homes in it. Thus, Charles and Sadie should label
  the blocks \(1\) through \(947\), and then select \(15\) of these at
  random. Once the \(15\) blocks are selected, all \(20\) homes on each
  should be visited. One possible sample would be
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
##  [1] 834 499 529 376 910 931 549 620 623 169 419 754 296  80 276
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  A major issue with this type of clustering is that homes that are on
  the same block are likely to be fairly homogenous. That is, city
  blocks will often be divided by socioeconomic status, education, and
  other demographic factors. As a result, selecting a full cluster is
  not likely to give a representative cross-section of the complete
  city, and instead, is likely to be skewed based on which clusters
  happen to be included. It seems very likely that with a survey
  investigating thoughts towards charitable giving, socioeconomic
  factors will play a role.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

The major concern with cluster sampling is that, if the clusters are
grouped together based on relevant information, the sample becomes
predictably unrepresentative of the overall population. Because the
clusters are often naturally formed based on a relevant factor (like
geographic location), if this factor influences the topic that is being
studied, the clustering design will influence the validity of the
results. Still, cluster sampling, when done correctly, alleviates many
of the difficulties with practically implementing a simple random
sample.

\begin{remark}[Systematic Sampling as Cluster Sampling]
Mathematically, systematic sampling can be seen as a particular form of
cluster sampling. To see this note that, once \(k\) and \(m\) are
defined, the set of individuals who are included in any given sample are
completely defined and grouped together. As a result, you could preform
these groupings of individuals, and treat those as clusters together.
Then, instead of sampling individuals, you are sampling a cluster of
individuals.

The key difference between cluster sampling and systematic sampling is
that the clusters in systematic sampling are not typically naturally
defined. There is not normally going to be a clear separation forming
the groups in this way, and as a result, it may not be easier to run a
geographically isolated systematic sample than it is to run a
geographically isolated simple random sample. However, the understanding
of equivalence mathematically is useful when data from these samples are
to be analyzed as the tools from cluster random sampling can be put to
use to validly analyze systematic data.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Stratified Random
Sampling}\label{stratified-random-sampling}

The key issue with cluster sampling is that natural clusters of
individuals typically exhibit self-similarity. This is an issue when
your sample is formed via complete clusters, however, it can be turned
into a benefit to ensure a greater reliability of the sample itself.
Exploiting this self-similarity leads to a sampling technique known as
stratified sampling.

\begin{definition}[Stratified
Sampling]\protect\hypertarget{def-stratified-sampling}{}\label{def-stratified-sampling}

In stratified sampling the population is divided into
\emph{sub-populations} known as strata. These strata should be comprised
of groups of similar individuals. A simple random sample is formed
within each strata, and each of the simple random samples are combined
together to form the overall sample.

\end{definition}

The major benefits of stratified sampling are two-fold. First, you will
typically have more precision in your conclusions being drawn than from
other sampling schemes. The reason being that individuals within a
strata will be similar to one another, and so the variability that will
arise based on which individuals are included is smaller than in other
sampling schemes. Second, you are able to split your data into the
different sub-populations describing results and conclusions for each
group of individuals. This allows us to make conclusions both at the
population level as a whole, but also at the sub-population level, which
is often of direct interest.

To implement stratified sampling, you need to decide how many
individuals will be sampled within each strata. A simple but effective
way of doing this is to use \textbf{proportional allocation}. With
proportional allocation the strata that are larger will have more
members sampled than the strata which are smaller, which is a natural
decision to make. To implement stratified random sampling with
proportional allocation: 1. Divide the population into strata, based on
a relevant and natural dividing criteria. 2. Within each strata, conduct
a simple random sample of size \(n_j\), where \(n_j\) is given by
\(n\times\frac{N_j}{N}\), where \(n\) is the desired sample size,
\(N_j\) is the size of the \(j\)th strata, and \(N\) is the size of the
population as a whole. This should be rounded to the nearest whole
number. 3. Form the sample by including all members from each of the
sampled strata.

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Push for Transportation
Infrastructure]\protect\hypertarget{exm-stratified-sampling}{}\label{exm-stratified-sampling}

Charles and Sadie have faced some push-back on their attempts to
increase access to well-funded public transportation options within
their city. To understand better where the resistance is coming from,
they decide to conduct a survey of households in the town. There are
\(18940\) total homes in the city, and Charles and Sadie figure that
perhaps household income levels will influence opinions on investments
in public infrastructure. Charles and Sadie categorize \(940\) of these
households as high income, \(10000\) as middle income, and the remaining
\(8000\) as low income. Suppose that they want a sample of size
approximately \(75\) from this population.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe how a stratified sample can be formed in this setting.
\item
  What potential drawbacks are there from using stratified sampling
  here?
\item
  What other factors may have been useful to segment the population into
  natural strata?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  This population is made up of three strata, with \(N_1 = 940\),
  \(N_2 = 10000\), and \(N_3 = 8000\). Using proportional allocation
  this will result in a sample from the first of size
  \(n_1 = \dfrac{940}{18940}\times 75 = 3.7 \approx 4\). For the second
  we get \(n_2 = \dfrac{10000}{18940}\times 75 = 39.6 \approx 40\). For
  the third we get
  \(n_3 = \dfrac{8000}{18940}\times 75 = 31.6 \approx 32\). Taken
  together this gives \(76\) as the sample size, which is close to
  desired. Then, three separate simple random samples are to be formed.
  The first is a sample of \(4\) homes randomly selected from the
  numbers, \(\{1,\dots,940\}\), the second is \(40\) homes randomly
  selected from \(\{1,\dots,10000\}\) middle income homes, and the
  remaining \(32\) are selected from \(\{1,\dots,8000\}\) from the low
  income households. These three groups are combined together, and
  interviewed to form the overall sample.
\item
  The major drawback is that this is likely to result in a costly
  sampling scheme. Specifically, as contrasted with the cluster sampling
  in Example~\ref{exm-clustered-sample}, there is no guarantee that
  Charles and Sadie would not be required to travel across many of the
  blocks in their city. It is possible that to visit the \(76\)
  households, they have to visit \(76\) different blocks, which greatly
  increases the cost of administering the sample as described.
\item
  It may have also been useful to stratify the population, for instance,
  based on vehicle ownership, based on commuter status, or based on
  political leanings. Each of these is likely to be relevant to subgroup
  analyses, while also reducing the variability within the strata
  themselves.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

While stratified samples are often the most efficient samples,
statistically, they do not alleviate many of the practical concerns
regarding simple random samples. In fact, in some cases, these issues
may even be exacerbated. If, for instance, strata are formed on the
basis of geographic location, then forming a stratified sample will
guarantee that it is required to visit each geographic location. The
sampling scheme which is selected should be concordant with the goals of
the analysis as well as the restrictions and constraints that are at
play.

\subsection{Multistage Sampling}\label{multistage-sampling}

Sometimes the nature of the population, question of interest, or
constraints at play render any single sampling design ineffective to
construct a useful sample. In these cases multistage sampling can be an
effective way of tailoring the sampling design to the specific
requirements.

\begin{definition}[Multistage
Sampling]\protect\hypertarget{def-multistage-sample}{}\label{def-multistage-sample}

In multistage sampling one or more of the discussed sampling techniques
are combined into a multistage procedure to effectively and efficiently
target the population of interest. Multistage sampling may combine
simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, cluster sampling, or
stratified sampling in different sequences and orders to achieve a
custom-specified sampling scheme.

\end{definition}

For example, household surveys are commonly run. To do so, a researcher
may randomly sample cities in the area of interest. Within those cities,
they may stratify based on region in the city, and within each region
cluster based on the blocks. Then, a simple random sample within the
blocks is taken, and those households are selected. This sampling scheme
can be understood in relation to each of the component sampling schemes,
and creates a flexible way of constructing a sampling scheme which meets
the needs of the situation.

\section{Experimental Design}\label{experimental-design}

While sampling is often a useful framing for collecting data, there are
times where our goal is not to simply understand the way that a
population is, but rather to understand the impact of particular
intervention. Consider, for instance, studies which look at the efficacy
of medical treatments, the utility of new fertilizers on agricultural
yield, or the impact of political interventions on climate change. In
each of these cases we are not interested in the current state of a
population, but rather how some action influences the state of a
population. For this, we turn to the process of experiment design. In
experimental design we seek to understand how \textbf{experimental
units} have their \textbf{response variables} impacted, based on the
\textbf{levels} of particular \textbf{factors}, or \textbf{treatments}.
In plain language our goal is to understand how specific interventions
influence some trait in a population. To proceed we formally define each
of these concepts.

\begin{definition}[Experimental
units]\protect\hypertarget{def-experimental-unit}{}\label{def-experimental-unit}

Individuals or items upon which the experiment is being performed. If
the experimental units are humans, we will often call them subjects or
patients, in place of units.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Response
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-response-variable}{}\label{def-response-variable}

The characteristic or trait of the experimental unit that is measured or
observed. The experiments purpose is to understand how a response
variable reacts to a particular intervention.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Factor]\protect\hypertarget{def-factor}{}\label{def-factor}

A variable whose effect on the response variable is of interest. The
factor is the variable which is being controlled or manipulated within
the experiment, and is the \emph{cause} of the change in response
variables.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Levels]\protect\hypertarget{def-levels}{}\label{def-levels}

The possible values of a factor. We are often comparing two or more
levels of the factor, determining how specific levels impact the
response variable.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Treatment]\protect\hypertarget{def-treatment}{}\label{def-treatment}

A treatment refers to the complete experimental condition. That is, the
set of all levels across all factors that are assigned to an
experimental unit. In one-factor experiments, this is the levels of the
single factor. In multifactor experiments, a treatment is a combination
of the levels of the factors.

\end{definition}

In an experiment, experimental units are observed after having been
given the treatment. The response variable is measured, and compared
across the different levels of the factors (or across the different
treatments) to determine how the various treatments impact the outcome.
In a well-structured experiment it is possible to conclude that the
treatment \emph{causes} a particular impact on the response variable, so
long as the analysis takes into account the limitations of the
experiment that was run.

\begin{example}[Sadie's House Plant
Growth]\protect\hypertarget{exm-treatments}{}\label{exm-treatments}

Sadie has become very interested in understand the conditions under
which house plants will thrive. Through some informal experimentation
Sadie believes that the frequency of watering, type of fertilizer, and
amount of sunlight are all important factors in the plant growth. Sadie
is predominantly interested in determining the impact on the height of
the plants.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Indicate the experimental units, response variable, factor(s),
  possible level(s), and treatment(s) in this proposed experiment.
\item
  Indicate further examples of response variables and factors that may
  be relevant to Sadie's question of interest.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In this experiment, the units are the houseplants that Sadie is
  watching. The response variable will be the height of the plants
  (measured in, for instance, centimeters). The factors under
  consideration are the frequency of watering, type of fertilizer, and
  the amount of sunlight. Some possible levels for frequency of watering
  may be weekly, versus biweekly, versus monthly. Some possible levels
  for type of fertilizers may be natural compost, synthetic compost, or
  no fertilizer. Some possible levels for the amount of sunlight may be
  direct, indirect, or no sunlight. The treatments will be comprised of
  the combinations of the different levels for the three outlined
  factors (for instance, weekly watering, with natural compost, and
  direct sunlight; weekly watering, with natural compost, and indirect
  sunlight; etc.). If these levels are considered then there will be a
  total of \(3\times 3 \times 3 = 27\) total treatments under
  consideration.
\item
  Sadie may instead wish to measure something to do leaf size, or stem
  width, or number of flowering plants. Each of these will produce
  different results, and will be useful for slightly different sets of
  considerations that Sadie may have. For other factors, Sadie may
  consider the pot size, or perhaps exposure to other
  stimulus.\footnotemark{}

plant growth.}

\subsection{The Principles of Experimental
Design}\label{the-principles-of-experimental-design}

Just as there were many different schemes for constructing a sample,
there are also many different experimental designs. We will explore two
common designs, but it is useful to first understand the guiding
philosophy of experimentation in Statistics. There are three key factors
that ensure that data collected from an experiment are useful for
drawing scientific conclusions.

First, is the idea of statistical control. It is not enough to know
whether or not a particular treatment was followed by a positive
response in the response variable. Instead, we require there to be some
point of comparison. We call this point of comparison a statistical
\textbf{control}. The idea is that we should always be comparing two or
more treatments, even when our interest is in one particular treatment.
If the treatment of interest is truly beneficial, we should be able to
see this by comparison to other treatments. This way, we are able to
ensure that the changes in the response variable that we see are related
to our intervention, rather than by random chance. Sometimes we wish to
see whether a particular treatment is effective, and there does not
exist another treatment option that is a plausible candidate. In these
cases, we often will take a treatment option to be ``nothing at all'',
which is to say no direct intervention on the given factor.\footnote{In
  medical studies this takes the form of a placebo: a treatment which
  looks like a medical treatment but has no active ingredients.} In this
way our control can still be used to see if our active intervention
improves over doing nothing, when that is the alternative.

Beyond statistical controls, experiments rely on \textbf{randomization}
and \textbf{replication}. With randomization the idea is that the
treatment that each experimental unit gets should be be randomly
selected, without consideration of the specific unit. This way
unintentional selection bias can be avoided within the groups. For
instance, in a medical study, if you end up giving the experimental
treatment to patients who are otherwise healthier, then you may expect
that the experimental treatment will produce better results not because
it was more effective, but because the patients who received it are the
ones who are expected to have better outcomes irrespective of
treatments. In addition to randomization, replication serves a central
role in experimentation. The experiment should be conducted on a
sufficient number of experimental units to ensure that random noise does
not cloud conclusions. In particular, the sufficient sample size will
ensure that the groups created via randomization will truly resemble
each other, and the more units in the study, the better able you are to
discern differences which exist between treatments. These principles can
be put to work across various different experimental designs, depending
on the specific experimental setup and constraints that are at play.

\subsection{Completely Randomized
Design}\label{completely-randomized-design}

The key question when defining an experimental design is how do the
experimental units get assigned to the various treatment options. The
most obvious choice is to randomly assign each unit to one of the
treatment options, ignoring any underlying factors about the units. This
is considered a \textbf{completely randomized design}.

\begin{definition}[Completely Randomized
Design]\protect\hypertarget{def-completely-randomized-design}{}\label{def-completely-randomized-design}

A completely randomized design is one in which the experimental units
are randomly divided into groups, one for each treatment in the
experiment. The treatments are then assigned to each of the groups,
randomly selected for each.

\end{definition}

Typically we will consider an equal assignment of numbers of
experimental units to each treatment option, though this is not strictly
required. In the completely randomized design, we ignore anything that
we may know about the experimental units beforehand.

\begin{example}[Sadies Houseplants: Completely Randomized
Design]\protect\hypertarget{exm-completely-randomized-design}{}\label{exm-completely-randomized-design}

Sadie is going forth with experimentation to understand how different
factors impact the height of house plants. Sadie decides to test
treatments comprised of combinations of three factors: watering
frequency (low frequency high volume versus high frequency low volume),
fertilizer use (store bought fertilizer, versus homemade compost, versus
no fertilizer), and sun exposure (direct sun exposure, versus indirect
sun exposure, versus artificial light exposure). There are a total of
\(72\) house plants, and Sadie wishes to use a completely randomized
design.

Describe how this experiment can proceed as outlined by Sadie.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

There are a total of \(2\times3\times 3 = 18\) different treatment
options. This means that for each treatment option,
\(\dfrac{72}{18} = 4\) houseplants should be assigned to it. We can form
these \(18\) groups by sampling \textbf{without replacement} from the
numbers \(1\) through \(72\), \(4\) at a time. Each number is assigned
to one of the houseplants, and that forms the groups. For instance, the
\(18\) groups may be:

\begin{verbatim}
##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
##  [1,]   66   48   47   38
##  [2,]   17   34    1   15
##  [3,]   14    8   68   71
##  [4,]   35   26   62   42
##  [5,]   37   11   61    2
##  [6,]   72    4   19   67
##  [7,]   41   64   18   25
##  [8,]   69   39   10   70
##  [9,]   50   53   30   33
## [10,]   40   29   31   24
## [11,]   16   49   32   36
## [12,]   20   44   55   51
## [13,]   22   65   59   54
## [14,]   60    6   13   45
## [15,]   23    3   52   46
## [16,]    9    5   43   57
## [17,]   58   28   63    7
## [18,]   56   27   21   12
\end{verbatim}

Then, each of the groups gets assigned one of the treatments (low
frequency/store bought/direct exposure; low frequency/store
bought/indirect; low frequency/store bought/artificial; etc.). The
treatments are given to the units, and then the heights are measured and
recorded alongside the treatment that was assigned.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

There are at least two shortcomings of completely randomized designs
which we may wish to overcome. The first is that, in a completely
randomized design, we may not be able to understand the impact on
subpopulations of interest. Because randomization occurs without
consideration of any other factor it is also not possible to directly
analyze how treatment may impact the outcome variable segmented by these
factors. While this is often not the primary question of interest, it
will often be the case that having answers to these types of questions
is desirable. Second, a completely randomized design may be less
efficient at capturing the true effect of treatment, when treatment is
mediated by other factors. If some groups of experimental units respond
more favourably\footnote{Or less favourably\ldots{}} than others,
ensuring that treatment allocation is split within these groups will
lead to more precise estimates of the true treatment effect. As a
result, we will often turn to more involved experimental designs to
allocate treatment options.

\subsection{Randomized Block Design}\label{randomized-block-design}

When we wished to exploit the structure of a population in sampling,
making use of systematic differences, we divided the population into
groups called strata on the basis of these traits. We can do the same
thing with our experimental units forming \textbf{blocks} of
experimental units. This blocking procedure gives rise to the
\emph{randomized block design}, an alternative to a completely
randomized design.

\begin{definition}[Randomized Block
Design]\protect\hypertarget{def-randomized-block-design}{}\label{def-randomized-block-design}

A randomized block design assigns treatments randomly to all units
within a block of experimental units. That is, the experimental units
are separated into various blocks, and then within each block a
completely randomized procedure is used.

\end{definition}

With the use of the block design, you are able to assess not only is
there an overall impact of treatment on the response variable, but also
is this impact of treatment impacted\footnote{Or ``mediated''.} through
the blocking factor(s). This may be of scientific interest directly, and
it also may help to ensure that random noise does not erode the ability
to discern the true impact of treatment on the outcome. Typically,
blocking factors will be natural factors which are suspected, or known,
to influence the outcome, but which are of secondary interest to the
experimenter.

\begin{example}[Sadie's House Plants: Randomized Block
Design]\protect\hypertarget{exm-randomized-block}{}\label{exm-randomized-block}

Of Sadie's \(72\) plants, \(18\) of them are species of trees, \(18\) of
them are species of vines or other crawlers, and the remaining \(36\)
are flowering plants. If Sadie decides to test treatments comprised of
combinations of three factors, watering frequency (low frequency high
volume versus high frequency low volume), fertilizer use (store bought
fertilizer, versus homemade compost, versus no fertilizer), and sun
exposure (direct sun exposure, versus indirect sun exposure, versus
artificial light exposure), how can a randomized block design to perform
this experiment?

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

Here, the type of plant is the natural blocking factor. There are \(18\)
different treatment options. This means that for each type of plant we
perform a completely randomized design with \(18\) treatments. To do so,
we can assign each of the trees to a single treatment option (there are
\(18\) trees and \(18\) treatments, so this is a matter of simply
randomizing the order of treatments and assigning one to each), we can
assign each of the vines to a single treatment option (same as with the
trees). For the flowering plants, there are \(36\) of them and \(18\)
treatments, so each treatment should have two different plants. If we
label the flowering plants \(1\) through \(36\), then we can simply draw
\textbf{without replacement} from the numbers \(1\) through \(36\),
\(2\) at a time. For instance, the \(18\) groups may be:

\begin{verbatim}
##       [,1] [,2]
##  [1,]    2   11
##  [2,]   17    4
##  [3,]   14   10
##  [4,]   36   21
##  [5,]   15    1
##  [6,]    9   29
##  [7,]    3   12
##  [8,]   18    7
##  [9,]    8   26
## [10,]   16   35
## [11,]   20   24
## [12,]   22    5
## [13,]   25   30
## [14,]   23   19
## [15,]   31   32
## [16,]   27    6
## [17,]   33   34
## [18,]   28   13
\end{verbatim}

Then, each of the groups, within each of the blocks gets assigned one of
the treatments (low frequency/store bought/direct exposure; low
frequency/store bought/indirect; low frequency/store bought/artificial;
etc.). The treatments are given to the units, and then the heights are
measured and recorded alongside the block and the treatment that was
assigned.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{Data Description and
Organization}\label{data-description-and-organization}

Whether data are collected via sampling or experimentation, it is
important to ensure that statistical principles are followed so that the
observed data are representative of the population of interest and
useful for accomplishing the goals of the statistical analysis. There is
a substantial amount of statistical work which goes into ensuring that
data collection is valid. Once valid data have been collected, we must
\emph{do} something with them. As previously discussed, there are
typically four use cases for data. In this course, our focus is on
description and inference. Before we can use the data to describe
patterns or conduct inference, we must first develop a shared language
around what data \emph{are}. Some of this has been informally introduced
throughout our discussions thus far, however, the formal definition
remains important for ensuring the foundation for statistical analyses.

\begin{definition}[Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-variable}{}\label{def-variable}

A characteristic or trait that can vary from one observation to the next
is called a variable. Variables are the relevant pieces of information
that are recorded in our data. We may have one or more variable recorded
for each individual unit in our data.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Observation]\protect\hypertarget{def-observation}{}\label{def-observation}

An observation is an individual piece of data. Our data are comprised of
multiple observations across the various units in our sample (or on our
experimental units).

\end{definition}

Generally speaking, we make observations of variables, and together this
forms our data. We use the data to answer the questions of interest or
conduct our analyses. Every variable can be categorized as either a
\textbf{qualitative} or \textbf{quantitative} variable. Qualitative
variables are the non-numeric variables we observe, following categories
or other less structured formats. Quantitative are numeric variables.

\begin{definition}[Qualitative
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-qualitative-variable}{}\label{def-qualitative-variable}

Any variable which is not numerical, such as those which fit into
categories, are referred to as qualitative variables.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quantitative
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-quantitative-variable}{}\label{def-quantitative-variable}

A quantitative variable is any variable which is described numerically.

\end{definition}

Quantitative variables can be either discrete or continuous. We saw this
distinction when working with random variables, and the distinction is
equivalent in the case of variables in a collected dataset as well. A
variable is considered discrete if it can take on a (countable) number
of listable values. A variable is considered continuous if it can take
on any value from a defined range of values. Often times, just as with
random variables, we make the distinction based on how we wish to think
about the variables, rather than based on the theoretical underlying
truth.\footnote{As a result, times, heights, or volumes will often be
  considered continuous even if theoretically they are discretized.}

\begin{definition}[Discrete
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-discrete-var}{}\label{def-discrete-var}

A quantitative variable which can take on values from a listable set.
There are either finitely many options for the variable, or else a
countably infinite number.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Continuous
Variable]\protect\hypertarget{def-continuous-var}{}\label{def-continuous-var}

A quantitative variable that can take on an uncountably infinite number
of values is called continuous. Continuous variables can theoretically
take on any value over a range of values, with the possibilities unable
to be enumerated.

\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Charles and Sadie Categorize
Variables]\protect\hypertarget{exm-variable-type}{}\label{exm-variable-type}

Charles and Sadie realize that oftentimes there are many different ways
of measuring qualities or traits that are of interest in a study. Upon
realizing this, they begin to discuss a number of topics, considering
how they may be measured.

For each of the following traits, discuss different options for
variables that could represent the quantity discussed. For each, include
possibilities which are qualitative and those which are quantitative,
and specify whether the quantitative are discrete or continuous.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Charles suggests that there are many ways of thinking about attained
  education.
\item
  Sadie, still thinking of plants, realizes that there may be many ways
  of thinking about the size of different plants.
\item
  Based on an overheard conversation, Charles wonders how socioeconomic
  status may be measured.
\item
  Sadie, after enjoying a snack at the coffee shop, thinks about how we
  might measure the quality of food.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colback=white, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, breakable, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm]

\vspace{-3mm}\textbf{Solution}\vspace{3mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Attained education may be a qualitative variable if it is described
  via categories (for instance, high school, college diploma,
  undergraduate degree, etc.) It could almost be made to be quantitative
  if, for instance, you measured the total number of years that someone
  had formal education for. This would be a discrete quantitative
  variable.
\item
  The size of different plants could be qualitative by using subjective
  sizes (for instance, small, medium, and large). It is possible to
  measure these quantitatively as well, for instance by considering the
  height or volume of the plant. Likely height and volume both are best
  considered continuous values, but they may be discretized in certain
  datasets.
\item
  Socioeconomic status can be a qualitative variable if, for instance,
  it is categorized on the basis of high/medium/low. To form a
  quantitative variable here you may consider household income, or
  wealth. Depending on how income or wealth are measured it may be
  discrete (for instance, counting the number of thousands of dollars)
  or continuous (if you listed exact dollar figures). This is an example
  of a variable which is \emph{always} discrete, technically, but may be
  better treated as continuous.
\item
  Food quality could be categorically rated (bad/average/good), or on a
  similar graded scale (S/A/B/C/D). Alternatively, the food could be
  subjectively graded numerically, giving for instance a star rating
  (out of \(5\)) or a rating out of \(100\). Likely these ratings would
  be discrete, but would be possible to come up with a continuous rating
  scale if that were desired.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{example}

\section{From Data to Insight}\label{from-data-to-insight}

Whether data are collected via sampling or via experiments, the data
themselves are not particularly useful for insight. If you are presented
with a large dataset, it will likely not be possible to directly
interpret the data, or communicate a message. Instead, we need to take
the data as input and convert them to more useful products. The
remainder of this course will focus on ways of doing this within
statistics.

We will focus both on how to summarize and communicate data that have
been collected, and then how to begin gaining insight from these data.
These are the first two roles of statistics, as introduced before:
description and inference. All of the roles that statistics plays build
from the idea that we have been able to collect data which are somehow
relevant and representative of the underlying population of interest. We
investigate the data, describe what has been observed in the sample, or
attempt to conduct inference not because we are interested in the data
themselves, but because we hope that the data will be reflective of the
population of interest. We are not primarily interested in the
statistics that we calculate, but on what these statistics say about the
parameters of interest.

It is important, as we begin to explore how we can use data directly, to
keep in mind that the entire statistical enterprise relies on having
high quality data available. This relies on having measured the factors
that we care about, in ways that are meaningful. It relies on
representative samples and well-designed experiments. Without adhering
to the principles discussed throughout this chapter, statistics cannot
proceed in a way which addresses our goals. High quality data is not a
substitute for statistical analysis, but it is a prerequisite for it.
