<p>While we gave the mathematical formulation for the frequentist interpretation of probability, we will typically require a more detailed mathematical model to work with probabilities. We want a description, framed in terms of mathematical objects, which will allow us to work out the probabilities of interest. In general, to form such a probability model we need both a list of all possible outcomes that the experiment can produce, as well as the probabilities of these outcomes.</p>
<p>We call the list of outcomes that can occur from an experiment the <strong>sample space</strong> of the experiment. The sample space is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, and is defined as the set of all possible outcomes from the experiment. For instance, if the experiment is flipping a coin we have <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\}\)</span>. If the experiment is rolling a six-sided die then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)</span>.</p>

<p>For Sadie and Charles their experiment involves tossing a coin three times in sequence. As a result each outcome is a three-dimensional list of values, given for instance by <span class="math inline">\((\text{H},\text{H},\text{H})\)</span>. As a result, we can write down the full sample space as <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{S} = \{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{H}), (\text{T},\text{T},\text{T})\}.\]</span></p>

<p>With the sample space formally defined, we can introduce the formal concept of an event. Formally, an <strong>event</strong> is any collection of outcomes from an experiment. Mathematically, that means that an event is a subset of the sample space. Take for instance the experiment of a single coin. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{H}\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{T}\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{H},\text{T}\}\)</span> are examples of possible events. [TODO: clarify <span class="math inline">\(E_j\)</span>.] Here, <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> corresponds to the event that a head is observed, <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> corresponds to the event that a tail is observed, and <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span> corresponds to the event that either a tails or a heads was observed. Note that for each event we have <span class="math inline">\(E_1 \subset \mathcal{S}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_2 \subset \mathcal{S}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E_3 \subseteq \mathcal{S}\)</span>.</p>
<p>While <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> each correspond to a simple outcome from the sample space, <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span> corresponds to a combined event. We call direct outcomes <strong>simple events</strong> and more complex outcomes like <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span> <strong>compound events</strong>. A simple event is an event that occurs in only one way: it is a direct outcome of the experiment. A compound event is an event that can occur in multiple, different ways, with multiple outcomes satisfying the event.</p>
<p>If we consider rolling a six-sided die, then an example of a simple event is that a four shows up, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\{4\}\)</span>. A compound event could be that an even number is rolled, <span class="math inline">\(\{2,4,6\}\)</span>, or that a number greater than or equal to four is rolled, <span class="math inline">\(\{4, 5, 6\}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The event of interest in the game played by Sadie and Charles is either that at least two heads are rolled, or that at least two tails are rolled. These are both compound events as there are multiple possible outcomes that correspond to each event. For instance, we can take the event that at least two heads are rolled to be given by <span class="math inline">\(\{(\text{H},\text{H},\text{H}),(\text{H},\text{H},\text{T}), (\text{T},\text{H},\text{H}), (\text{H},\text{T},\text{H})\}\)</span>.</p>

<p>We say that an event “occurs” if any of the outcomes comprising the event occur. As a result we can have more than one event occurring as the result of an experimental run. Consider the events “an even number was rolled” and “a number greater than or equal to four was rolled.” If a four or a six are rolled, both of these events happen simultaneously.</p>
<p>Above, with <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span>, we saw that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> can be thought of as an event since <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{S}\)</span>. This is the event that some (any) outcome is observed, which is certain to happen, and so we know it happens with probability <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. There is one further “special” event which is important to consider the so-called <em>null event</em>. Denote <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>, the null event is an event that corresponds to “nothing in the sample space”. We know that everytime an experiment is run something in the sample space occurs, and so the null event is assigned probability zero.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we think of all events as being sets. These sets are subsets of the sample space, and can contain single or multiple outcomes. Every quantity that we are interested in can be expressed as some set of outcomes of interest. In building up these sets it is common to construct through the use of “and”, “or”, and “not” language.</p>
<p>Consider the example of drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck. In such a deck there are 13 card ranks, and four card suits, with one of each combination present. If we draw a single card we can think of the outcomes of the experiment as being any of the 52 possible combinations of rank and suit. However, we are often interested in an event such as “the card is red”, which is the same as saying “the card is a heart <strong>or</strong> the card is a diamond.” If we are interested in the event that the ace of spades was drawn, this can be expressed by saying that “the card was a spade <strong>and</strong> the card was an ace.” Perhaps we want to know whether the card was an ace through ten, this is the same as saying “the card is not a Jack, Queen, <strong>or</strong> King.”</p>
<p>As you beginto pay attention to the linguistic representation of events that we use, you will notice more and more the use of these words to form compound events in particular. As a result, we give each of them a mathematical operation which allow us to quickly and compactly express these quantities in notation.</p>
<p>We incapsulate <strong>or</strong> through the use of an operation known as the union. The union between two sets, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, is denoted mathematically as <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B\)</span>, and is read <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> union <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. In words, the union of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the set which contains all elements that are in either <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (or both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>). When we wish to take the union of many sets, we write this as <span class="math display">\[\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i.\]</span></p>
<p>Alongside the union, we introduce the intersection, which captures “and”. The intersection of two sets, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, is the set that contains all elements that belong to both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. We write this as <span class="math inline">\(A \cap B\)</span>, and say “<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> intersect <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.” When we wish to take the union of many sets, we write this as <span class="math display">\[\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i.\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we can consider making formal the concept of “not.” In particular, we take the <strong>complement</strong> of a set to be the set of all elements which occur in the universe but are not in the given set. We write this as <span class="math inline">\(A^C\)</span> and say “<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> complement.” When dealing with a sample space, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, the complement of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the set of all elements in the sample space that are not in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>TODO: example block with card hands.</p>
<p>These concepts allow us to more compactly express sets of interest, and in particular, will be quite useful when it comes to assigning probability. To practice, considering rolling a 6-sided die, and take the outcomes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to be that a <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is rolled, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to be the outcome that the roll was at least <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to be the outcome that the roll was less than a <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to be the outcome that the roll was odd.</p>
<p>If we consider <span class="math inline">\(D^C\)</span> this is the event that the roll was even; <span class="math inline">\(A \cup C\)</span> is the event that a <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> was rolled or that a number less than 44$ was rolled, which is to say anything other than a <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> or a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>; if we take <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B\)</span> then this will be the same as <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\cap B\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. If we take the event <span class="math inline">\(A\cap C\)</span>, notice that no outcomes satisfy both conditions, and so <span class="math inline">\(A \cap C = \emptyset\)</span>. We can also join together multiple operations. <span class="math inline">\(D^C \cap C\)</span> gives us even numbers than less than <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, which is to say the outcome <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\((A \cap B)^C\)</span> would represent the event that a number less than <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is rolled.</p>
<p>Working with these basic set operations should become second nature. There are often very many ways of expressing the same event of interest using these different operations, and finding the most useful method of representing a particular event can often be the key to solving challenging probability questions. The first step in making sure that these tools are available to you is in ensuring that the basic operations are fully understood, and this comes via practice. Remember, unions represent “ors”, intersections represent “ands”, and complements represent “nots”.</p>
<p>The sample space is partitioned into outcomes, and the oujtcomes can be grouped together into events. These events are sets and can be manipulated via basic set operations. Sometimes it is convenient to represent this process graphically through the use of Venn diagrams. In a Venn diagram, the sample space is represented by a rectangle with the possible outcomes placed inside, and events are drawn inside of this as circles containing the relevant outcomes.</p>
<p>On the Venn diagram then, the overlap between circles represents their intersection, the combined area of two (or more) circles represents their union, and everything outside of a given circle represents the complement of a set. This can be a fairly useful method for representing sample spaces, and for visualizing the basic set operations that we use to manipulate events inside the sample spaces. A word of caution: Venn diagrams are useful tools, but they are not suitable as proof tools. It is possible to convince yourself of false truths if th e wrong diagrams are used, and as a result, Venn diagrams should be thought of as aids to understanding, rather than asa rigorous tool in and of themselves.</p>
<p>TODO: Add Example with Graphical Venn Diagrams</p>
<p>Sample spaces, events, and the manipulation of these quantities forms a critical component of understanding probability models. In particular, they describe the complete set of occurences in a statistical experiment that we could be interested in assigning proobability values to. To finish formalizing a probability model, however, we also need some rule for assigning probability values.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of ways to assign probabilities to diffferent events. At the most basic of levels any rule that maps from the space of possible events to numbers between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> are possible candidates for probability assignment. That is, probability assignmnet at its core is simply a set of rules which says “for this event, assign this probability.”</p>
<p>TODO: Add example of coin toss space.</p>
<p>Not every assignment of probability values is going to be valid. Suppose, for instance, that we have a six-sided die, each side labelled with a number from one to six. If I told you that there was a probability of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> that it comes up <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, you would probably call me a liar (or else conclude that I was mistaken and likely should not be teaching probability). If, as we have previously seen, probabilities represent the long-run proportion of time that a particular event is observed, we cannot have <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> different outcomes each occuring in half of all caes.</p>
<p>beyond the requirements that we can impose on what consitutes a “valid” probability function, we have another concern: scalability. It is perfectly acceptable to indicate that in an experiment with <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> outcomes, the first has a probability of <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span>, the second of <span class="math inline">\(0.3\)</span>, and the third of <span class="math inline">\(0.45\)</span>. What if the experiment has <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> possible outcomes? Or <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>?It quickly becomes apparent that enumerating the probabilities of each event in the sample space is an efficient way of assigning probabilities in practice.</p>
<p>A core focus of our study of probability will be on finding techniques that allow us to efficiently encode probability information into manageable objects. Once we have done this, we will be in a position where we can manipulate these (comparatively) simple mathematical quantities in order to make statements and conclusions about any of the events of interest, even if they have never been explicitly outlined as having an assigned probability.</p>
<p>While we will consider myriad methods for accomplishing these goals throughout our study of probability, we begin with a very useful model which simplifies probability assignment, without any added complexity, and creates a solid foundation for us to explore the properties of probability models. We start by considering <strong>equally likely outcomes.</strong> As the name suggests, the probability model considering equally likely outcomes assigns an equal probability to every possible outcome of the experiment. This is a probability model that we are already distinctly familiar with: flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card are all examples of experiments which rely on theequally likely outcomes framework.</p>
<p>TODO: Write aside about the use of urn models.</p>
<p>If we have an experiment with a sample space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> which has <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{S}| = k\)</span> total elements, then each element of the sample space occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{k}\)</span>. In the case of the coin toss example, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\}\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> and each outcome occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. in the case of drawing a card at random, there are <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> different outcomes, and so <span class="math inline">\(k=52\)</span>, and the probability of drawing any particular card is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{52}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is critically important to recognize that the equal probability model assigns equal likelihood to the possible outcomes of an experiment, not the possible events of interest. It will not be the case in general that all events have the same probability. To make this concrete, consider the events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> “the ace of spades is drawn” and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> “any spade is drawn”. It is quite clear that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> happens more frequently than <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, even though we have said that this is an experiment with equally likely outcomes. Remember: an outcome is an observation from a single experimental run, an event is any subset of these possible outcomes.</p>
<p>A core goal is then bridging the gap between the probability of an outcome - something which in the equally likely outcomes frameowkr we know - and the probability of an event - the quantity we are actually interested in. In ordder to do so, we will next consider the rules of probability, introducing the properties that are required for valid probability assignments and the techniques for manipulating probabilities to calculate the quantities of interest.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rules-of-probability"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Rules of Probability</h2>
<p>We have previously seen that not every probability assignment can be valid. For instance, assigning <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> probability to each outcome on a die leads to a nonsenical scenario. with just a little imagine we can conjure equally nonsensical scenarios in other regards. For instance, it would make very little sense to discuss the probability of an event being a negative value. What would it mean for an event to occur in a negative proportion of occurences? Alternatively, we can consider two events that are nested in one another: say event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is that we draw the ace of spades, and event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is that we draw any spade. Every single time that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> happens, we know that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> also happens. But there are ways that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can occur wwhere <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does not (for instance, the Queen of spades being drawn). If I told you the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> and the probability of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>, this would violate our base instincts: how can it be more likely to draw the ace of spades than it would be to draw any spade at all?</p>
<p>Often in mathematics when we have an intuitive set of rules that particular quantities must obey, we work to add formality through defining properties of these concepts. To this end, we can define the key properties that probabilities must obey in order to be well-defined, valid probabilities.</p>
<p>It turns out that with three (fairly) basic properties, we can completely specify what must be true in order for a set of probabilities to be valid.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Unitary</strong> Every valid set of probabilities must assign a probability of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to the full sample space. That is, <span class="math inline">\(P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\)</span>. This is an intuitive requirement as every time the experiment is run we observe an outcome in the sample space, and as a result, in every experimental run the event <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Non-negative:</strong> We require that every probability is non-negative. We can have probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, but we can never have a probability less than zero. Again, this is sensible (what would it mean to have a negative probability?), but is important to include in our formalization. Specifically, for everyevent <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X) \geq 0\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Additivity:</strong> the final property requires slightly more parsing on first pass. Suppose that we define a sequence of events, <span class="math inline">\(E_1, E_2, E_3, \dots\)</span> such that no two events have any overlap. That is, <span class="math inline">\(E_j \cap E_\ell = \emptyset\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\ell\neq j\)</span>. Then, the final property we require for probabilities is that <span class="math display">\[P\left(\bigcup_i E_i\right) = \sum_i P(E_i).\]</span> That is, the probability of the union of disjoint events is the summation of the probability of these events.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is worth dwelling slightly on property (or axiom) 3 further. Consider the case of drawing a card at random from a deck of <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> cards. Using the equally likely outcome model for probability we know that the probability that any card is drawn is given by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{52}\)</span>. If I were to ask “what is the probability you draw that ace of spades?” under this model you can respond, immediately, with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{52}\)</span>. Now, if I were to ask “what is the probability that you draw the ace of spades or two of spades?” intuitively you likely figure that this will be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{52}\)</span>. Note that the event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, “draw the ace of spades” and the event <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> “draw the two of spades”, are disjoint events. Moreover, recall that the union is the “or” and so <span class="math inline">\(E_1\cup E_2\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. Taken together then, <span class="math display">\[P(E_1\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2).\]</span> The axiom of additivity simply extends this intuition to an arbitrary number of events.</p>
<p>TODO: insert example about additivity.</p>
<p>These three axioms fully define valid probabilities. Any mechanism that assigns probability values to events which conforms to these rules will assign valid probabilities. While it may seem counter intuitive that such basic rules fully define our notion of a probability, these rules readily give rise to many other properties that are indispensible when working with probabilities.</p>

</ol>
<p>TODO: write aside that proves these from the basic properties.</p>
<p>TODO: am I missing any?</p>
<p>These properties are immensely useful when computing probabilities. in fact, these secondary properties will be used with more frequency than the basic axioms when manipulating probabilities in practice. It is worth building comfort with these properties, early and often, as they will assist in manipulating all probability expressions in the future.</p>
<p>TODO: Example showing complement trick.</p>
<p>While these properties hold in general for all probability models, it is instructive to consider to focus on the equal probability model to begin building familiarity with probability broadly. These porperties allow us to take events – whether compound or simple – and combine, rewrite, and manipulate expressions to assist in the handling of the computations. Eventually, however, we require the ability to assign numerical values to these probabilities.</p>
<p>Consider a simple event, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Recall that a simple event is defined as a possible outcome of an experiment, and so in this case, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> corresponds directly to an event that may be observed. If our sample space is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements large, then <span class="math inline">\(P(A) = \frac{1}{k}\)</span> in this framework. For instance, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the event that a two is rolled on a six-sided fair die, then <span class="math inline">\(P(A) = \frac{1}{6}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that a compound event is defined, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. By definition, a compound event can be expressed as a set of possible outcomes from the experiment. Suppose that we enumerate these possible events as <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_\ell\)</span>. Then we know that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occurs if any of <span class="math inline">\(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_\ell\)</span> occur. Each <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span> are elements of the sample space and correspond to possible outcomes of the experiment. As a result, we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(b_j) = \frac{1}{k}\)</span>, based on the equal probability assumption. Now, if we take any two distinct <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span>, we know that they must be disjoint: <span class="math inline">\(b_i \cap b_j = \emptyset\)</span>. This is because in an experiment run only one outcome can occur – there is nothing common between these two events, by definition. Moreover, we can say that <span class="math inline">\(B = b_1 \cup b_2 \cup\cdots\cup b_\ell\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the axioms of probability outlined above we therefore know that <span class="math inline">\(P(B) = \sum_{j=1}^\ell P(b_j) = \sum_{j=1}^\ell \frac{1}{k} = \frac{\ell}{k}\)</span>. This holds in general for any compound event in this setting. If we take <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to be the event that an even number is rolled on a six-sided die, then we would have <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> is the event that a two is rolled, <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> is the event that a four is rolled, and <span class="math inline">\(b_3\)</span> is the event that a six is rolled. There are three such events, and so the probability that an even number is rolled must be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\)</span>, which matches our intuition.</p>
<p>If we consider what this process is doing at its core, we can reframe the calculation as counting up the number of ways that event can happen and dividing by the total number of events. In our previous discussion, there were <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> ways of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occuring, a total of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> outcomes, and so the probability becomes <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\ell}{k}\)</span>. in the equal probability model, this will always be the case, the probability of any event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occuring is given by <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \frac{N_A}{k},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> is the number of unique ways that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can occur. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> is the size of the set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a result of the realization, a large part of computing probabilities is in the counting of possible outcomes corresponding to different events. If we can determine the count of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span>, and the count of the total number of occurences, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, then we can determine the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This study of counting is known as <strong>combinatorics</strong>, and it is where we will turn our attention next.</p>
<p>TODO: include example that shows the utility of complements, again. Show specifically for counting where, for instance, the complement is very small and is easier to count.</p>

<section id="combinatorics" class="level2" data-number="2.4">
<h2 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combinatorics"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Combinatorics</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, counting is a matter of assessing the size of a collection of items. Sometimes, this is very straightforward: if you want to count the number of students in a classroom, you start at <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and enumerate upwards through the integers. To count the number of days until the next Holiday, you do the same thin, sizing up the time that has to pass. If you really need to sleep, perhaps you will count imaginary sleep until you drift off. There is not much to this type of counting, and it is certainly deeply familiar to you all. However, it is also quite limited in its utility.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are interested in determining how many possible ways there are of arranging a deck of $524 cards. You could of course arrange them in a particular order, then count each of those. That would take a tremendous amount of time, so perhaps instead of using an actual deck you just write down the combinations. Still, each combination is going to be <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> cards long, and keeping track of that all will be a tremendous challenge. This seems like an approachable question, and yet, it illustrates how complicated (and large) these types of “counting” problems can become, very quickly.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us there are some strategies for simplifying these problems down, some of which you are likely already familiar with. Think about trying to form an outfit where you have <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> different sweaters, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>$ pairs of pants, and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> options for your shoes. Suppose that any combination of these will work well. How many are there? Well, if you have already picked your sweater and pants, then there are going to be <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> different outfits using these: one wiht each of the pairs of shoes. This is true for each ppossible sweater-pant combination, and so we can count <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> for each one these. In otherwords, to get the total number of outfits we multiply the number of sweater pant combinations by the number of shoe options (<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>). the same rationale can be applied to count the total number of sweater-pant combinations. For each sweater, there are <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> pairs of possible pants, and so to get the total number there we can take <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> for each possible sweeater, or in other words, #3$.</p>
<p>Taken together then we have <span class="math inline">\(4\times 3\times 2 = 24\)</span> total possible outfits. Another way of framining this is that we have to make three sequential decisions: which of the <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> sweaters, which of the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> pants, and which of the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> shoes are to be worn. When we do this we multiply through the number of alternatives at each decision point to get the total number of combinations.</p>
<p>This is known as the <strong>multiplication rule for counting</strong>, and it is a very general rule for counting up total combinations. Any time that we have to make a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> choices, and each choices <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\dots,k\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> options, then the total number of combinations will be <span class="math inline">\(N = n_1\times n_2\times\cdots\times n_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>TODO: add examples for the counting rule.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to express the counting rule graphically. To do so we rely on <strong>tree diagrams</strong>. A tree diagram puts each of the decisions in sequence, and draws a branch for each separate option. You start with the first choice, drawing one branch for each of the <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> alternatives, labelling each. Then, at the second choice, you do the same process at the end of each of the branches you drew for choice <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, this time drawing <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> branches there (so you will have just drawn <span class="math inline">\(n_1\times n_2\)</span> branches). Then for each of those you draw the <span class="math inline">\(n_3\)</span> further branches, and so on and so forth until the end.</p>
<p>If you want to know the total number of choices, you simply count the end points at the very end of the diagram. Each branch corresponds to a single option. To determine which combination of choices it corresponds to, you simply read off the branch labels at each branch you take. If you want to know how many possible combinations come with certain options selected, you canlook at only those branches which are downstream from the choices that you care about.</p>
<p>TODO: include tree diagram.</p>
<p>While tree diagrams can be quite useful for visualizing a problem, they often grow to be overly complex. As a result, we often need to fall back on the numerical representation afforded to us through the product rule for counting. Counting problems, in general, can very quickly become tremendously large and complex. For this reason, we have several tools to assist us in reducing this complexity based on common types of problems that we would like to count.</p>
<p>The first useful tool for simplifying these problems is the <strong>factorial</strong>. The factorial of an integer, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(x!\)</span> (factorials are exciting because they always look like they are shouting!) is given by the product of all integers from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(x! = x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(2)(1)\)</span>. If we consider the product rule for counting then note that if <span class="math inline">\(n_1=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_2=2\)</span>, … , <span class="math inline">\(n_k = k\)</span>, then the total number of options is <span class="math inline">\(k\times(k-1)\times\cdots\times 1 = k!\)</span>. The most common reason that this comes up is when we want to order a collection of items. Suppose that you have <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> books that you want to plae on a shelf. You can view this as making <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> sequential decisions: what book goes first, second, third, and so on. There are <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> options for the first book, then <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> for the second (any except for the first one), and then <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> for the third (any except for the first <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>). This continues down to the last book, and so we conclude that there are <span class="math inline">\(10\times9\times8\times\cdots\times1 = 10!\)</span> ways of arranging these books.</p>
<p>TODO: Additional example on factorial.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we want to still order items from a collection, but we want to only use a subset of these tiems. That is, suppose that you have <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> books, only <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> of them will fit on the self, and so you want to know: how many ways can you put <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> books on the shelf, in order, from your collection of <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>. Using the product rule of counting for this directly we can recognize that there are <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> options for the first, then <span class="math inline">\(19\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(18\)</span>, and so on until there are <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span> choices for the <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>th book to place. We can write this out in a seemingly strange way. <span class="math display">\[\frac{20(19)(18)(17)(16)(15)(14)(13)(12)(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}{10(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}.\]</span></p>
<p>This expression is <span class="math inline">\(20!\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(10!\)</span>, and gives the same as our argument from the product rule for counting directly. This is a more general result than our example with books would suggest. If we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> items, and we want to choose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of them and then order those choices, it will always be <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\((n-k)!\)</span>. We call this a <strong>permutation</strong>. Formally, we write <span class="math display">\[P_{n,k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\]</span></p>
<p>Permutations arise when we select ordered subsets from a collection. We often, in combinatorial problems, talk about ordering, though sometimes what we mean by this is slightly more abstract. Suppose that you want to form a committee with <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> different people, each of whcih occupies a different role: the president, vice president, treasurer, note taker, and critic. If there are <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> people to select for this, then there are <span class="math inline">\(P_{30,5}\)</span> total possible committees that can be formed. While there is not a sequential order here, we talk about this as being ordered since we can differentiate between the five roles. Instead of labelling them with their names, we could label them <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and make the ordering more explicit.</p>
<p>TODO: include additional example on permutations. TODO: 0! = 1.</p>
<p>Factorials compute the number of orderings for a set of objects, and permutations compute the number of ordered subsets from a collection of ojects. What about when we do not wish to differentiate the order of subsets? Suppose that you still need to form a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> person committee, but you do not have explicit roles for the different members of the committee. Here we cannot use a permutation directly, as we know that this takes into account the order. Suppose that we formulate the ordered committee in a separate way: first, we select <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> people without concern for their order, then we choose which order they will have.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> represents the number of unordered sets of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> from this population, the product rule for counting tells us that the total number of ordered committees will be <span class="math inline">\(M\times 5!\)</span>, since there are <span class="math inline">\(5!\)</span> arrangements. Thus, we can write this down as <span class="math display">\[P_{30,5} = \frac{30!}{25!} = M\times 5! \implies M = \frac{30!}{25!5!}.\]</span> Once again, this will be true far more broadly than our committee example: if we want to select <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> items from a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we will have <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> divided by the product of <span class="math inline">\(k!\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((n-k)!\)</span>. We refer to these as <strong>combinations</strong>.</p>
<p>We will write <span class="math inline">\(\binom{n}{k}\)</span>, which we read as “<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> choose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>”, which translates to “select <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> items from a population of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> total options, without concern for their order.” Formally, a combination is defined as <span class="math display">\[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\]</span></p>
<p>To summarize: factorials allow us to order a complete collection, permutations allow us to select a subset with consideration of the ordering, and combinations allow us to select a subset from the collection without regard to the order. These three techniques can be used in combination with the product rule for counting to allow us to have very complex total summations.</p>
<p>TODO: introduce example for combinations. TODO: introduce extended examples for counting, mixing the different techniques.</p>
<p>There are other types of counting problems which ocassionally need to be considered. [TODO: include counting with replacement].</p>
<p>While combinatorics is a field of study on its own, with many intriguing tools and developments surrounding the neumeration of objects, for the purposes of simple probability models these tools will suffice. Ultimately, we care about counting since in the equal probability model, the probability of any event can be determined by counting the number of ways that the event can occur and dividing by the total number of outcomes that are possible. That is, we use these tools to derive <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span>, the total number of ways that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can occur, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the total number of experimental outcomes, and then we conclude that <span class="math display">\[P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N}.\]</span></p>
<p>TODO: include brief probability example.</p>
